The A92 project was approved as a project by the American Standards \nAssociation in 1948. In 1959, the National Safety Council withdrew as primary sponsor, and spon-\nsorship was assumed by the American Society of Safety Engineers. In October, 1960, the American \nMutual Insurance Alliance became a cosponsor of the project. \n. \nAt the inception of this project, the A92 Committee was concerned only with manually-propelled \nmobile scaffolds and platforms. In 1961, the committee extended its scope to include 11 second project \non vehicle-mounted elevating and rotating work platforms. The development and increasing use of \nsuch equipment had reached a stage where minimum specifications governing design and manufac-\nture of such devices were necessary. This standard sets forth minimum requirements that must be \nconsidered and built into the devices to provide for proper and safe operation. \nThe use of aerial devices is subject to certain hazards that cannot be protected against by me-\nchanical means, but only by the exercise of intelligence, care, and common sense. It is, therefore, \nessential to have competent and careful operators, physically and mentally fit, and thoroughly trained \nin the safe operation of aerial devices. \nSuggestions for improvement gained in the use of the standard will be welcome. They should be \nsent to the American National Standards Institute, 1430 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10018. \nAt the time it approved this standard, the A92 Committee had the following members: \nRobert L.
