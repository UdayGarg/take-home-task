These \nare suggested actions only, and shall in no case take precedence over the guidance presented \n elsewhere in this instruction.  \n AREA OFFICE COORDINATION  \nCoordination within the Area Office is absolutely essential in the orderly conduct of a PQV \ninspection. The Area Director and all those involved in a PQV inspection must commit the resources \nwith the understanding that the project is long-term, possibly several weeks or months. It is \nimperative that team members complete all outstanding assignments prior to the PQV inspection. \nEqually important, team participants should not be directed or \"asked\" to do assignments while they \nare engaged in the PQV inspection. An obvious exception would be court hearings, over which the \n Area Office has little control.  \nThe Area Director should designate a contact person in the Area Office to coordinate and oversee all \naspects of the inspection. The contact person should be a supervisor, safety or industrial hygiene \n(IH), who is familiar with the PQV concept. In addition to providing Area Office coordination, the \ncontact person would review the entire case file/report. The team leader would communicate at least \n weekly with the contact supervisor, who would then brief the Area Director as appropriate.  \n INSPECTION TEAM COMPOSITION  \nBy design, a PQV inspection is a large and complex undertaking, to be accomplished by a select, \nwell-trained team. All members of the team must be experienced journey or senior level compliance \nofficers who are familiar with the chemical industry and have taken the appropriate OSHA training. \nNewer compliance officers can be utilized in the inspections, but not as a substitute for regular team \n members.  \nThe team should consist of two safety compliance officers/engineers, two industrial hygiene \ncompliance officers, an administrative support person and a construction specialist. The team leader \ncould be from either discipline in the team, but preferably a safety specialist, due to the fact that most \n of the critical PSM and construction related hazards reside in the area of safety.  \nThe team leader should be a GS-12 Senior Compliance Officer with experience in large team \ninspections. He or she should have excellent organizational and communication skills, both oral and \nwritten. It would also be of benefit that the team leader be knowledgeable in word processing and \ndata base management computer operations. Since the team leader will be the focal point during the \nconduct of the inspection, that person should also have demonstrated leadership abilities. The entire \nteam, the company, employees/unions and other OSHA personnel will look to the team leader for \n  direction and answers to the many questions that will arise during the course of the inspection.", "requirement_type": "mandatory", "source_document": "REG-29 CFR 1910 119.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-29 CFR 1910 119.pdf-714", "section": "OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *", "title": "NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy", "text": "* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *\nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.", "requirement_type": "optional", "source_document": "REG-29 CFR 1910 119.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-29 CFR 1910 119.pdf-715", "section": "OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *", "title": "NOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only", "text": "* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *\nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n\n\nPage 127:\n \n \n[Page G-3] \n \n DOCUMENTS  \nPQV inspections will require compliance officers to review numerous company documents. Many of \nthese documents will become part of the case file as documentation for potential citations or for \ndocumentation of the required PSM elements. It is imperative that these documents be organized and \nidentified so that they may be readily referenced and reviewed. It is highly recommended that all \nrequests for copies of company documents be in writing. A standard document request format should \nbe established and should contain at least the following information:", "requirement_type": "mandatory", "source_document": "REG-29 CFR 1910 119.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-29 CFR 1910 119.pdf-716", "section": "Comment section (did the response fulfill request).", "title": "It should be noted that there is no universal language used to identify documents", "text": "9. Comment section (did the response fulfill request).\n \nIt should be noted that there is no universal language used to identify documents. Different \ncompanies have different names for the same type of document. It is therefore essential to clearly \ncommunicate what information is needed and desired prior to writing the request. The document \nrequests should be in duplicate: one copy for the company and the other to be retained in the case \nfile. To avoid long discussions and legal department involvement, all documents obtained should be \n considered proprietary information.  \nPrior to the documents actually being received, a filing system should be developed. The system \nshould be secure, accessible to all team members and ensure that individual documents are easily \nretrievable. The administrative support person could manage the filing system to ensure its continued \neffectiveness. NOTE: Only appropriate documents should be maintained in the filing system; field \nnotes, document \"clips\", and document review/evaluation notes should remain with the \n corresponding 1B's.  \nExhibit 2 contains a list of those documents most commonly requested. It is divided into two \n sections: Pre-Unit Selection and Unit-Specific Documents.  \n INSPECTION FACILITIES  \nThe PQV team needs a suitable work area/command center from which the inspection can be \nconducted and coordinated. Except in the most unusual of circumstances, the company will provide \nthe requisite onsite space. Almost any room will suffice, providing it meets some basic requirements. \nThe work area must be secure 24 hours a day with access limited to the inspection team and those \ncompany officials who would respond in an emergency. This is important so as to preclude taking \nboxes of documents and equipment in and out each day. The room should have sufficient desks \nand/or tables for reviewing documents and writing the report. Provisions should be made for \ncommunications--one phone line as a minimum. Outgoing calls should be charged on the Area Office \ncalling card. Where phone service is not provided, the team should have a portable cellular phone.", "requirement_type": "mandatory", "source_document": "REG-29 CFR 1910 119.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-29 CFR 1910 119.pdf-717", "section": "OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *", "title": "NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy", "text": "* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *\nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.", "requirement_type": "optional", "source_document": "REG-29 CFR 1910 119.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-29 CFR 1910 119.pdf-718", "section": "OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *", "title": "NOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only", "text": "* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *\nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n\n\nPage 128:\n \n \n[Page G-4] \n \nSufficient power outlets should be available for charging pumps, batteries and other inspection \n equipment.  \nThe inspection team will need copies of a number of documents. It is hoped that the company would \nprovide copying services or the use of a copy machine. The administrative support person could \n make the copies should the company not provide these services.  \nThe team leader must determine as soon as possible, what--if any--of the necessary facilities the \ncompany will provide. If the company does not provide all of the necessary facilities voluntarily, or \nputs disruptive restrictions on their use, the ARA for Technical Support should be contacted as soon \nas possible so that alternate facilities can be arranged. This may result in the use of a rented copier(s) \n and office space.  \n INSPECTION EQUIPMENT  \nUpon entry to the site, the inspection team should be fully prepared with all necessary inspection \nequipment and personal protective equipment. Exhibit 3 contains a list of equipment that may be \nuseful to prepare for the inspection. In addition, an inspection \"kit\" is outlined which can be used to \nset up the command center. Some of the items in the \"kit\" may appear to be trivial; however, all of \nthese items will be needed at some time during the inspection. It may not be practical to go back and \nforth to the office or a store to get these items, particularly if the inspection site is in a remote \nlocation. The administrative support person would be responsible for maintaining adequate supplies \n throughout the inspection.  \n CRITICAL INSPECTION AREAS  \nIt is essential that team members have specific subjects and areas to investigate. The team leader, \nwith input from the team members, should assign the inspection areas prior to entry. This will help to \navoid confusion and duplication of effort. In addition, the team members will be able to be better \n prepared for their individual tasks.  \nAs inspection subjects are completed, the information should be reviewed with the team leader \nbefore going on to the next assignment. The state of compliance or noncompliance within any given \narea may require the team leader to modify the assignment list so as to make the most of the \n resources available.  \n CONTRACTORS  \nContractors are an integral part of any PSM inspection. There may be only a few contractors or \ndozens, with several hundred contract employees, depending on whether the facility is undergoing a \n shutdown or turnaround.  \nIt is imperative that, upon entry, the scope of the contractor activity be determined. The construction \nspecialist on the team will have to formulate an inspection plan and set appropriate priorities. It is not \nthe intent of the PQV inspection to inspect all outside contractors that are on-site, rather to inspect \nonly those contractors who may be exposed to, or could cause or be affected by a catastrophic \nincident.

Remote construction projects not associated with catastrophic potential \n would not necessarily be inspected.  \nThe term \"contractor\" is not limited to construction type activities. Many chemical facilities use \ncontract maintenance workers, vessel and piping inspectors, vessel heat treating, cleaning, \nengineering and similar non-construction contractors who remain at the facility year round or are \ncalled in at regular intervals. They are used to supplement existing plant personnel for regular duties \n and for special projects.  \nA shared responsibility for both contractors and company is quality assurance. It is essential that all \nmaterials and workmanship meet engineering standards. There should be sufficient checks to ensure \nthat materials, such as the proper alloy or carbon steel pipe is used, and that the studs and/or bolts are \n of the proper size and grade. This is especially important in contractor supplied materials.  \n CRITICAL EXPERTISE  \nSituations may arise in a PQV inspection that are beyond the technical expertise of the team \nmembers. A list should be developed identifying OSHA personnel and/or private sector experts and \nhow they may be contacted. Areas where this expertise may be needed are:", "requirement_type": "mandatory", "source_document": "REG-29 CFR 1910 119.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-29 CFR 1910 119.pdf-721", "section": "Industry practice", "title": "By no means is this list all-inclusive", "text": "9.

Since \nthe team will be made up of journey-and senior-level CSHOs, good documentation is to be expected. \nAll OSHA-1B forms must be complete and legible.
