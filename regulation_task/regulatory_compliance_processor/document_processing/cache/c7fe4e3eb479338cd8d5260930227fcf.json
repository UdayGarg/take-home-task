The committee\u2019s activities in \nthis regard are limited strictly to interpretations of the standard or to the consideration of revisions to the present \nstandard on the basis of new data or technology. As a matter of policy, API does not approve, certify, rate, or \nendorse any item, construction, proprietary device, or activity; accordingly, inquiries requiring such consideration \nwill be returned. Moreover, API does not act as a consultant on specific engineering problems or on the general \nunderstanding or application of the rules. If, based on the inquiry information submitted, it is the opinion of the \ncommittee that the inquirer should seek assistance, the inquiry will be returned with the recommendation that \nsuch assistance be obtained. All inquiries that cannot be understood because they lack information will be \nreturned.\nE.2\ufffd\nInquiry\ufffdFormat\nInquiries shall be limited strictly to requests for interpretation of the standard or to the consideration of revisions \nto the standard on the basis of new data or technology.

This information shall include reference to the applicable edition, revision, paragraphs, figures, \nand tables.\nc) Inquiry\u2014The inquiry shall be stated in a condensed and precise question format. Superfluous background \ninformation shall be omitted from the inquiry, and where appropriate, the inquiry shall be composed so that \n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d (perhaps with provisos) would be a suitable reply.
