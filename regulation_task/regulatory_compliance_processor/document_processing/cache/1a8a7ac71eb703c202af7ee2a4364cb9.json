This random back-off is selected on basis of a Contention Window \n(CW) and is chosen in the interval [0, CW].  \nAfter the medium has been idle for at least a DIFS, the back-off timer is decremented by one \nfor each time slot that the medium remains idle. When the timer becomes zero, the frame is transmitted. \nIf however, during the decrementing of the back-off timer, the medium becomes busy, the timer is frozen \nduring that time and resumed after the channel is sensed idle again for more than DIFS.  \nThere are collisions when more than one wireless stations start to transmit simultaneously. \nHence, for being ensured of the successful transmission, upon the reception of a frame, the receiver \nsends an Acknowledgement (ACK) frame to the sender. This ACK frame is sent after the SIFS. If \nhowever, there is no ACK frame received, then the station assumes that there has been a collision. It \nreschedules the frame and enters the back-off procedure again. To reduce the probability of collisions, \nthe station doubles the contention window for each retransmission attempt. The Collision window can \nbe expanded up to a maximum limit of CWmax. After a successful transmission, the contention window \nis reset to CWmin. Even after a successful transmission, before transmitting the next frame, a backoff \nis done, which is called \"post-backoff\".  \nFigure 6 shows a scenario where five stations are competing to access the channel. First, we \nassume that station A is transmitting its data frame. During A\u2019s transmission, new frames arrive at MAC \nsublayer of stations B, C and, D.

When the channel is sensed idle, stations B, C, and D \nrandomly determine their backoff values before attempting access the channel. Station B (with the \nlowest backoff value) is the next station to win the competition. Stations C and D must wait (and their \nbackoff timers are frozen). At the end of B\u2019s transmission, station D is the next to win the channel access. \nStation C should still wait. However during D\u2019s transmission a new frame arrives at station E MAC \nsublayer. At the end of D\u2019s transmission, station E determines its random backoff value, which is less \nthan the remaining backoff of station C. Thus station E wins the channel access before station C.

Relationship between DCF, PCF, EDCF and HCCA \n \na) Enhanced Distributed Coordination Function (EDCF) \nThe EDCF is the contention based part of the HCF. It works on the same principles as the DCF \nof IEEE 802.11, but is aimed to improve the contention-based access to channel to provide priorities. \nThe EDCA introduces at MAC layer four Access Categories (ACs) supporting eight User Priorities \n(UPs) also known as Traffic Categories (TCs).

Contention is within a QSTA between ACs, as well as between QSTAs for medium. Thus, \nthe eight different queues for the eight Traffic Categories within a station can be thought of as having \neight queues inside a station along with QoS parameters that decide their priority. If two traffic \ncategories have their counters zero at the same time, then we say that there has been a collision. Such a \ncollision is also called a virtual collision because it is not an actual collision on the air channel, but it \nhas happened virtually. Nevertheless, the back-off procedure is still executed.

To address the problem of unlimited transmission time of polled stations, a variable called the \nTXOPlimit is introduced, which limits the transmission opportunity of the polled station. The QAP can \nstart Controlled Access Phases (i.e. Contention-Free Periods) even during the contention period by using \nthe HCCA prioritized access mechanism. The PIFS interval is shorter than AIFS or DIFS. A TCAPlimit \nis defined to limit the TXOPs during a beacon interval and to allow enough space for EDCF.  \nBesides these, IEEE 802.11e also introduces two optimizations techniques that can significantly \nimprove performance: Block acknowledgement and Direct link protocol. \nBlock acknowledgement Mode can be negotiated between the QSTA and the QAP. Once the \nBlock ACK mode has been established, multiple QoS frames are transmitted with SIFS separating them. \nThis optimizes bandwidth as we don\u2019t need ACK for every frame. A single frame is used to acknowledge \nthe reception of multiple frames.  \nDirect Link Protocol introduces the possibility of transmitting frames from one QSTA to another \nbelonging to the same BSS directly, without the need for passing through the QAP. Normally, two \nQSTAs are not allowed to exchange frames directly with each other in a BSS, but only through the QAP. \nTo enhance the performance for cases when the two QSTAs are in the same BSS and have some high \nbandwidth demanding applications running, then the DLP facilitates the efficient use of the transmission \nmedium by allowing the two stations to communicate directly.  \nc) IEEE 802.11e Reference Scheduler and admission control \nUp to eight different traffic classes of different priorities are allowed in the station. Before any \ntraffic for a stream flows, the station sends a QoS request frame to the QAP carrying the Traffic \nSpecifications (TSpecs) of the traffic stream. The Minimum Data Rate, Mean Data Rate, Peak Data \nRate, Burst Size, Minimum PHY Rate, Minimum Service Interval, Maximum Service Interval and Delay \nbound fields in the TSpec express the characteristics of the traffic stream. When the QAP has received \nthese requests, it assigns its Scheduler to calculate service schedule and the TXOP for each given SI \n(Service Interval). The calculation of the scheduled service interval is done as follows: first, the service \nscheduler calculates the minimum of \u201cMaximum SI\u201d of all the admitted streams. Let this minimum be \nm. Second, the scheduler calculates a number smaller than m and which is a sub-multiple of the beacon \ninterval. This is the scheduled SI for all QSTAs with admitted streams. This same process is repeated as \nlong as the maximum SI of the newly admitted stream is larger than the current scheduled service \ninterval. If, however, the maximum SI of the newly admitted stream is smaller than the scheduled service \ninterval, the scheduler needs to change the scheduled service interval to a value smaller than the \nmaximum SI of this stream. The TXOPs also need to be recalculated with the new scheduled SI. If a \nstream is dropped, the scheduler might use the time available to resume contention. The scheduler might \nalso choose to move the TXOPs for the QSTAs following the QSTA dropped to use the unused time. \nHowever, this option might require the announcement of a new schedule to all QSTAs. Different \nmodifications can be implemented to improve the performance of the minimum scheduler. For example, \na scheduler might generate different scheduled SIs for different QSTAs, and/or a scheduler might \nconsider accommodating retransmissions while allocating TXOP durations. \nWhen a new stream requests admission, the admission control process is done in three steps. \nFirst, the ACU (Admission Control Unit) calculates the number of frames that arrive at the mean data \nrate during the scheduled SI for this stream. Second, the ACU calculates the TXOP duration that needs \nto be allocated for the stream. Third, the ACU performs a final check before accepting the new flow to \nbe sure that all the admitted streams have guaranteed access to the channel.", "requirement_type": "informative", "source_document": "REG-IEEE 802.11.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-IEEE 802.11.pdf-34", "section": "802.11", "title": "Networks", "text": "d) QoS for VBR traffic in IEEE 802.11 Networks\nProviding QoS to applications is a challenging yet necessary task.

It was meant to provide QoS to time-bounded multimedia \napplications. However, there are at least three main problems with the PCF approach that render \nit unable to provide the required QoS:  \nInefficient central polling scheme: All the communication between two stations in the same \nBSS has to be through the central Access Point. When the amount of traffic increases, \nthis kind of mechanism proves quite wasteful for the bandwidth as the stations are better \noff exchanging directly.  \no Unpredictable beacon delays: The alternating CP and CFP may result in the Beacon \nDelay problem. At TBTT (Target Beacon Transmission Time), a PC schedules the \nbeacon as the next frame to be transmitted. The beacon can be transmitted when the \nmedium has been idle for at least PIFS. However, if at this time (TBTT), if the medium \nis busy due to some unfinished transmissions, the time bounded frames in CFP will \nsuffer. The standard allows stations in Contention Period to transmit even if the \ntransmission will not finish before TBTT. Thus the CFP period starts late and some or \nall flows in it suffer. \no Unknown transmission time of polled stations: A station that has been polled by the PC \ncan send a single frame up to max of 2304 bytes, and that frame may be fragmented. \nFurther, different modulation and coding schemes are specified in IEEE 802.11a, thus \nafter polling a station, the PC cannot tell how long will it take for this station to finish \nits transmission. This disables any attempt to provide QoS to the remaining stations that \nare to be polled during the CFP.  \n \ne) QoS limitations of IEEE 802.11e for Variable bit-rate Traffic  \nTo provide QoS to applications in the wireless environment, the IEEE 802.11e standard has \nbeen proposed. However, the IEEE 802.11e is far from perfect. In certain scenarios and for certain types \nof applications, it fails to provide QoS guarantees. In the proceeding paragraph, we discuss the \nlimitations of the IEEE 802.11e standard and in particular the centralized scheduler. \nIn the HCCA mode, stations send reservation requests to the scheduler and based on the \ninformation provided in the reservation request about the flow, the ACU admits or rejects the flow. Then \nagain, based on the information about the characteristics of the flow, the scheduler allocates TXOPs to \nthe stations and polls stations in a simple round robin manner. However, the information on which the \nscheduler bases time allocation to stations is the averaged information about the characteristics of the \nflows. The assumption is that these traffic flows are constant bit-rate and will continue this trend. The \ntransmission duration of a station always stays the same in the reference scheduler and corresponds to \nthe transmission time of an average sized packet or a burst of average size (whichever takes longer time) \nat the minimum physical rate. When the traffics are variable bit-rate, the performance of the scheduler \ndegrades and it cannot guarantee QoS to the applications.  \nSeveral solutions have been proposed to deal with these limitations of IEEE 802.11e ([MAN02], \n[NI04], [NI05], [RAM05]). Among the proposed solution, we can mention:  \n\n\nPage 11:", "requirement_type": "mandatory", "source_document": "REG-IEEE 802.11.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-IEEE 802.11.pdf-39", "section": "802.11", "title": "standards \u2013 Z.

Mammeri\n \n\uf02d \nDynamic allocation of additional time to VBR flows: The Access Point gathers queue \ninformation from stations to see if variations from the traffic reservation have caused queue \nbuild-up at QSTAs and if so, then it allocates additional time to prevent high delays.  \n\uf02d \nVariable service intervals: The authors of this solution use the concept of token bucket of time \nunits or a TXOP timer for each QSTA. The transmission of a long burst in several SI spaced \nintervals leads to poor performance, but if the QSTA can use up its accumulated tokens at such \nneeded instants, such bursts of data can be handled without degrading quality. The TXOP timer \nof a station increases at a constant rate of TD/mSI where TD is its transmission duration and the \nmSI is its minimum Service Interval. The time that the station used in its TXOP is then deducted \nfrom its TXOP timer. Thus over the long interval, a QSTA still has its TXOP equal to its mean \ndata rate but it has more flexibility. \n\uf02d \nFlexible HCF (FHCF): This approach handles the dynamic variation of the flows by adjusting \nthe TXOPs of these flows, based on queue length estimations. It aims to be fair for both CBR \nand VBR traffic. There are two schedulers, the QAP scheduler and the node scheduler. The QAP \nscheduler calculates the ideal queue length of the TS (Traffic Stream) queues for each QSTA at \nthe beginning of the next SI. When a QSTA sends a QoS data packet, the QAP uses the QoS \ncontrol field of the IEEE 802.11e header to record its queue length at the end of TXOP. The \nQAP knows the time at which this TXOP ends, and hence using the queue length at the end of \nTXOP, the time at the end of TXOP and using other parameters like frame size and application \ndata rate, the QAP scheduler estimates the queue length of a TS at the beginning of the next SI. \nTo handle the case for VBR applications, the FHCF scheme uses a window of w already known \nreal queue measurements to adjust the estimation. Then, the QAP scheduler compares the \nestimated queue length to the ideal queue length and reallocates the TXOP accordingly. The \nnode scheduler also performs almost the same calculations. It has the task of redistributing the \nadditional allocated time to the different TSs within the node.", "requirement_type": "informative", "source_document": "REG-IEEE 802.11.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}]
