Various catalyst materials are available and include rare\nearth elements, precious metals such as platinum and palla-\ndium, and a few metallic salts. For commercial use, the catalyst\nmaterial is bonded to or mixed in with (in the case of ceramic\nor porcelain structures, pellets, or granules) the substrates\nspecified in the preceding list.\nFor atmospheric pollution control, catalyst materials fre-\nquently are installed in oven exhaust streams, and the in-\ncreased energy level resulting from hydrocarbon oxidation is\neither discharged to the outside atmosphere or recycled to the\nprocess oven, directly or by means of a heat exchange system.\nThe application of catalysts should recognize the inherent\nlimitations associated with these materials, such as the inability\nto oxidize silicone, sulfur, and halogenated compounds (cer-\ntain catalysts employing base metals \u2014 e.g., manganese and\ncopper \u2014 are resistant to halogens and sulfur poisons), as well\nas metallic vapors such as tin, lead, and zinc. These materials\ncan destroy catalyst activity, whereas various inorganic particu-\nlates (dust) can mask the catalyst elements and retard activity,\nthus making specific maintenance procedures necessary. Con-\nsultation with qualified suppliers and equipment manufactur-\ners is recommended prior to installation.\nWhere applicable, catalyst afterburner exhaust gases can\nbe permitted to be utilized as a heat source for the process\noven generating the vapors or some other unrelated process.\nHeat recovery can be indirect, by the use of heat exchange\ndevices, or direct, by the introduction of the exhaust gases into\nthe process oven.\nAlternatively, catalytic heaters can be permitted to be in-\nstalled in the oven exhaust stream to release heat from evapo-\nrated oven by-products, with available energy being returned\nby means of heat exchange and recirculation to the oven pro-", "requirement_type": "mandatory", "source_document": "REG-NFPA 86.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-NFPA 86.pdf-1666", "section": "10.6.4(a)", "title": "and Figure A.10.6.4(b).]", "text": "cessing zone. [See Figure A.10.6.4(a) and Figure A.10.6.4(b).]\nA.10.6.4.2\nThe temperature differential (T) across the cata-\nlyst should be monitored to ensure that catalytic oxidation is\noccurring. Separate temperature-indicating instruments or\ncontrollers can be used to determine T arithmetically. Control\nof fuel or electrical energy for preheating the fume stream\nentering the catalyst can utilize temperature-measuring instru-\nments at the catalyst inlet or discharge or at a juncture be-\ntween instruments in each location. Maximum permitted af-\nterburner temperature should be monitored only at the\ncatalyst bed exit. The value of T across the catalyst bed indi-\ncates the energy release and should be limited to values non-\ndestructive to the catalyst material.\nRegenerative catalyst oxidizers that employ flow reversal\nthrough the system do not produce a measurable T across the\ncatalyst bed indicative of the energy released from the oxida-\ntion of the combustibles. In regenerative catalytic oxidation\nsystems, the flow is reversed frequently through the system to\nmaximize utilization of process heat. One characteristic is that\nthe measured temperature at any one point in the system\u2019s\npacked beds, whether in the heat matrix (ceramic packing) or\nin the catalyst bed is never constant; rather, it is a sinusoidal\nfunction of time. Measuring before and after the catalyst bed\ndoes not show energy released from volatile organic com-\npound (VOC) oxidation. The fact that the catalyst bed is em-\nployed for VOC oxidation and heat recovery means that those\ntemperatures measured are dependent on flow rate, duration\nbetween flow reversals, concentration of VOC, VOC species,\nactivity of catalyst, and burner input.\nA.10.6.4.3\nConcentrations at 25 percent LFL can produce a\ntemperature rise near 600\u00b0F (316\u00b0C) that, where added to the\nrequired inlet temperature, results in temperatures generally\nconsidered to be within a range where thermal degradation\noccurs.\nIn the event of a high-temperature shutdown of the system,\nthe catalyst bed will need to be cooled to prevent further dam-\nage to the catalyst through thermal or high-temperature\nbreakdown. Most catalysts employ a high surface area sub-\nstrate, such as alumina, that allows for the maximum amount\nof catalyst material exposed to the fumes per unit of catalyst\n(pellet, granule, or structured packing). The surface area of\nthe catalyst can be diminished through failure of the pore\nstructure of the substrate at elevated temperatures [typically\ngreater than 1200\u00b0F (649\u00b0C)], which results in less exposed\ncatalyst material per unit of catalyst and a lower activity. This\nrate of thermal poisoning is a function of temperature and\nduration, and the net effect can be minimized by quickly cool-\ning the catalyst to safe operating temperatures, from 450\u00b0F to\n950\u00b0F (232\u00b0C to 510\u00b0C).\nA.10.6.4.4\nOxidation performance of catalyst material is a\nfunction of temperature, velocity, and pressure drop (P)\nthrough the bed, with bed size and configuration directly re-\nlated to these factors.

The air delivered into an oven\nby the supply system to do the necessary work can be all fresh\nair (from a source outside the oven), or it can be partly fresh\nair and partly recirculated air from within the oven. Only the\nfresh air supplied provides safety ventilation, and the amount\nof fresh air supplied must be equivalent to the amount of oven\nexhaust air, to keep the system pressure in balance. The\namount of air discharged from the oven by the exhaust system\nis a fair indication of the safety ventilation, provided the sup-\nply and exhaust systems are designed properly. The minimum\namount of fresh air delivered into the oven for safety ventila-\ntion is established by the amount of solvent vaporized from the\nwork in process. The method for determining the minimum\nvolume of fresh air necessary for safety ventilation is provided\nin A.11.6.8.4.\nMeasurement of Quantity of Air Exhausted from an Oven. A simple\nmethod determining the quantity of air exhausted from an oven\nis to measure the velocity of air through the discharge duct by\nmeans of a velometer, an anemometer, a pitot tube, or other\nsuitable means. This measurement then is used to calculate the\nvolume (cubic feet or cubic meters) of air per minute by multi-\nplying the velocity in lineal feet per minute (lineal meters per\nminute) by the cross-sectional area of the exhaust duct in square\nfeet (square meters). The temperature of the exhaust air also\nshould be measured, and the calculated volume then corrected\nto 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). The resultant quantity of air is an indication of\nthe volume exhausted from the oven, provided the exhaust air\ndoes not mix with air external to the oven. In many ovens, par-\nticularly those of the continuous type, the exhaust ducts have\nbeen incorrectly placed in locations that allow outside air to en-\nter the exhaust system together with the ventilation air exhausted\nfrom the oven.\nExample: For a continuous oven, determine the parts of\nexhaust air at 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) and fresh air at 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) that,\nwhen mixed, produce a resultant temperature of 242.5\u00b0F\n(117\u00b0C), given the following conditions:", "requirement_type": "mandatory", "source_document": "REG-NFPA 86.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-NFPA 86.pdf-1735", "section": "3", "title": "The temperature reading of outside air at the entrain-", "text": "(3) The temperature reading of outside air at the entrain-\nment site is 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C).\nU.S. Customary Units\nx = parts at 300\u00b0F\ny = parts at 70\u00b0F", "requirement_type": "informative", "source_document": "REG-NFPA 86.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-NFPA 86.pdf-1736", "section": "5y = 57.5x", "title": "", "text": "172.5y = 57.5x\n3y = x\nSI Units\nx = parts at 149\u00b0C\ny = parts at 21\u00b0C\n117(x + y) = 149x + 21y\n117x + 117y = 149x + 21y\n96y = 32x\n3y = x\nTherefore, 3 parts at 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) + 1 part at 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) =\n4 parts total at 242.5\u00b0F (117\u00b0C)\nIn this example, 75 percent of the air discharged by the\nexhaust fan is from inside the oven.

Air infiltration can occur at ef-\nfluents, open ends, or the perimeter of doors. In addition,\nwelds in a furnace shell can break, gasketed joints can fail, and\nradiant tube heaters can be breached, all of which could intro-\nduce additional sources of air infiltration. Furnaces should be\ndesigned to minimize sources of air infiltration. In addition,\nfurnace shell joints and radiant tube heaters should be peri-\nodically evaluated or tested and repaired as needed. Should\npositive furnace pressure be lost in furnaces or chambers op-\nerating below 1400\u00b0F (760\u00b0C), air infiltration can lead to a\nflammable gas\u2013air mixture that can result in an explosion.\nLoss of positive furnace pressure can be caused by an inad-\nequate flow of carrier gases or loss of furnace heat, and loss of\nfurnace heat will lead to the thermal contraction of the atmo-\nsphere volume.\nA.13.5.11.1(C)\nThe character of the flame at furnace open\nends and special atmosphere effluents will be a function of the\nspecific furnace. It is essential for the furnace operator to be\ntrained to recognize the \u201cestablished character\u201d of these\nflames. In addition, the operator should be aware of the typi-\ncal timing for flame to appear at open ends and effluent vents.\nA.13.5.11.1(D)\nThe fluid in a bubbler can be water or oil.\nBubblers might be provided to protect a furnace from over-\npressure or to maintain a minimum positive atmosphere pres-\nsure within the furnace. Bubblers also can control pressure\nwithin a bell furnace using an oil seal. Overpressure of the\nretort or work chamber could blow the oil out of the seal ring.\nIt is also possible to have water condensation accumulate in a\nbubbler bottle that can add to the liquid level and allow an\nincrease in furnace pressure, which could increase furnace\npressure to excessive levels and lead to the loss of oil seals.\nA.13.5.11.1(E)\nWhere flammable atmosphere effluent is re-\nleased unburned to the interior of a building, the accumula-\ntion of flammable gases could create a fire or explosion haz-\nard. To avoid this hazard, effluent that will not reliably ignite\nupon contact with air should be captured by a hood and dis-\ncharged to a safe outside location. See also A.6.2.6.3, which\naddresses additional hazards.\nA.13.5.11.1(F) The use of plant air with reducing regulators\nis prohibited. Plant air lines can become slugged with water\npassing into the heated furnace resulting in abnormally high\nfurnace pressures. Plant air lines can experience regulator fail-\nures resulting in high-pressure air admission into a furnace\nthat contains a flammable atmosphere.\nA.13.5.11.2(B)\nBurn-off pilots using full premix (fuel\u2013gas\nmixed with all the air needed to support full combustion) and\nglow plugs are examples of ignition sources meeting the in-\ntent of A.13.5.11.2(B). Full premix burn-off pilots have suffi-\ncient air (or, more precisely, sufficient oxygen in air) pre-\nmixed with the fuel gas to maintain the burn-off pilot if the\npurge gas or special atmosphere gas otherwise creates an\noxygen-deficient atmosphere that would not support the\nburning of the burn-off pilot flame.\nA.13.5.11.2(C) Where loss of ignition of vent effluent creates\neither an environmental or a personal safety concern, the pi-\nlot flame should be monitored and an alarm generated to\nalert the operator to loss of flame.\nA.13.5.11.2(E)\nThe ability to open doors manually in emer-\ngency situations is needed. Upon the simultaneous loss of fur-\nnace atmosphere and door pilot supervision, there will be a\nneed to purge or manually open doors to burn-out vestibules\nthat use an alternative source of ignition.\nA.13.5.11.2(G)\nIf burn-off pilots were equipped with flame\nsupervision interlocked to turn fuel gas off to the burn-off\npilot upon loss of flame, the burn-off pilots would also be\nturned off in the event of a power failure. The loss of burn-off\npilots at special atmosphere effluent points during a power\nfailure is undesirable and would create a serious safety con-\ncern with reliably maintaining ignition of effluents. Where\nflame supervision is provided, it is for an alarm to draw atten-\ntion to the need to relight the burn-off pilot or it is interlocked\nto prevent the opening of a furnace door.\nA.13.5.11.2(H) Burn-off pilots should be located where they\nwill contact the effluent stream.

Table A.13.5.11.11.10(A)\nsummarizes when the action should be automatic and when it\ncan be automatic or manual.\nPart 3 addresses the condition where there is a low flow of\ncarrier gas that will not maintain positive pressure within a\nchamber that is below 1400\u00b0F (760\u00b0C). If a chamber is above\n1400\u00b0F (760\u00b0C), the low flow condition might allow furnace\npressure to drop and might allow air infiltration; however,\nwhile this might lead to process issues, it is not a safety issue\nrequiring the removal of the special atmosphere. Following\noperating instructions, the operator can work to restore nor-\nmal process conditions.\nIt should be noted that Part 3 does not involve any measure-\nment of the actual furnace pressure. Rather, it is based on com-\nparing the actual carrier gas(es) flow with minimum allowable\ndesign flow rates. The actual carrier gas flow is measured with\nflow sensors. Furnace pressure is subject to fluctuation due to\nactions such as operating doors and loading or unloading work.\nThe inadvertent shutdown of carrier gases due to a routine fur-\nnace pressure fluctuation is considered more of a potential safety\nhazard than the actual pressure fluctuation itself.\nA.13.5.11.11.11(B) Where exothermic generated special atmo-\nsphere gases are used for purging, the flammable content of the\ngas is maintained at a limited level that when mixed with air\nwould not exceed 25 percent of LFL and therefore would not\nneed a safety shutoff valve. See 13.5.5.1(D)(2) for further guid-\nance on monitoring of purge gases for flammable components.\nA.13.5.11.11.11(E) See A.7.4.9.\nA.13.5.11.11.12(D)\nNormal shutdown of a furnace by burn-\nout is an example of a practice that causes a furnace chamber\nto lose positive pressure. However, this loss of positive pressure\ntakes place along with the controlled introduction of air to\neffect the burn-out of the flammable atmosphere. Safety shut-\noff valves are to close in response to this action, but there is no\nsafety issue with this intended case of furnace pressure loss.\nThe unintended interruption of a furnace heating system,\nunintended loss of furnace temperature, unintended reduc-\ntion of carrier gas flow, or unintended interruption of power\nare examples of conditions that can cause furnace chambers\nto lose positive pressure. These conditions, however, can lead\nto the uncontrolled infiltration of air into furnace chambers,\nwhich could rapidly lead to an unsafe condition (faster than\noperators might be able to respond) in some of or all the\nchambers. Chamber temperature will influence whether an\nunsafe condition can develop.\nWhere chamber temperature is at or above 1400\u00b0F (760\u00b0C),\nthe uncontrolled air infiltration could create process quality is-\nsues; however, it is not anticipated to create safety issues. This\nstandard has no requirement to initiate the removal of the spe-\ncial atmosphere in this case. Instead, the operator should follow\nwritten operating instructions and work to restore normal pro-\ncess conditions. The written operating instructions could include\ndirections to implement a controlled furnace shutdown if certain\nspecified conditions develop.\nWhere chamber temperature is below 1400\u00b0F (760\u00b0C), the\nuncontrolled air infiltration could create an explosion hazard.\nUnder these conditions, the safety shutoff valves for flam-\nmable special atmospheres will close, and the actions specified\nin 13.5.11.11.10(B)(1) should automatically occur.\nRegarding A.13.5.11.11.12(D)(4), where a carrier gas gen-\nerated by liquid dissociation is used, furnace temperatures\nneed to be maintained above a temperature that will maintain\nreliable dissociation of the liquid. In earlier editions of\nNFPA 86, the minimum temperature was stated as 800\u00b0F\n(427\u00b0C). This specific value has been removed from the stan-\ndard because there is more than one liquid used as a special\natmosphere, and each liquid should be evaluated for the mini-\nmum temperature that will reliably dissociate that liquid in the\nfurnace. Where a reliable dissociation temperature is not\nmaintained, the special atmosphere liquid might no longer\nmaintain a positive furnace pressure. Once positive furnace\npressure is lost, air infiltration will be possible, and a furnace\nexplosion hazard can develop.", "requirement_type": "mandatory", "source_document": "REG-NFPA 86.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-NFPA 86.pdf-1868", "section": "13.5.11.11.15", "title": "Vestibule explosion relief means usually con-", "text": "A.13.5.11.11.15 Vestibule explosion relief means usually con-\nsist of doors that remain in position under their own weight\nbut are otherwise unrestrained from moving away from the\ndoor opening if an overpressure occurs within the furnace.\nA.13.5.11.11.16\nNoncarrier special atmosphere gases can be\nflammable (e.g., enriching gas) or nonflammable (e.g., pro-\ncess air).

Usually it is a measurement of\noxygen or combustible gas concentration in the gas being ex-\nhausted from the furnace. Purge effluent gases from furnaces\noften contain condensed oil and water vapors, soot, and lubri-\ncant decomposition products. These materials can clog or ac-\ncumulate inside sample collection tubing and cause mislead-\ning analysis results. They can foul or damage instrument\nsensors. Consequently, most analyses are manual spot checks\nmade by an operator using portable instruments.\nManual analyses do not lend themselves to modern, auto-\nmated atmosphere control systems. Instead, instruments that\ncontinuously analyze sample streams are preferred. Unfortu-\nnately, they suffer from the sample conditioning problems\nmentioned and often do not provide the reliability needed.\nTimed Flow Purge Method. Measured dilution purging is also a\ndependable method for accomplishing a successful purge. Be-\ncause its results are certain and accurately predictable, its effec-\ntiveness does not need to be verified by using gas analyzers, pro-\nvided that the equipment, the purge gas, and the operating\nprocedures are not altered when future purges are performed.\nTherefore, a standardized timed flow rate measurement can be\nrelied on to perform without resorting to repetitive gas analyses\nduring routine operations of the furnace.\nDilution Purging. In dilution purging, the diluent gas is\nadded continuously to a furnace or vessel to lower the concen-\ntration of the component to be purged. The vent stream is also\ncontinuous. For example, air or the oxygen portion of air is\npurged out of a furnace using an oxygen-free purge gas. The\ngreater the volume of purge gas used in relation to the volume\nof the purged vessel, the lower the resultant oxygen content.\nIn most cases, the final oxygen concentration is independent\nof purge time duration.

This technique is not predictable if the gas cir-\nculation fans fail or if they are incapable of creating a homo-\ngeneous mixture throughout the furnace at the diluent flow\nrate used. Therefore, the time needed to conduct a dilution\npurge of a given furnace installation can be influenced by the\npurge gas flow rate. In a furnace equipped with a low capacity\ncirculation fan, the purge gas flow rate might have to be lim-\nited to ensure that the diluent gas is dispersed effectively\nthroughout the purged chamber as the purge proceeds.

The bellows and the diaphragm me-\nchanical gauges operate on a differential between atmo-\nspheric and process pressure.

For high vacuum work, the McLeod gauge is\noften used as a primary standard for the calibration of other,\nmore easily used instruments. The gauge is limited to intermit-\ntent sampling rather than continuous use. It operates on the\nprinciple of compressing a large known volume (V1) of gas at\nunknown system pressure (P1) into a much smaller volume (V2)\nat a known higher pressure (P2), as derived from Boyle\u2019s law, at\nconstant temperature. The gauge then is calibrated to read P1.\nThermal Gauges. The operation of a thermal gauge is based\non the theory that energy dissipated from a hot surface is pro-\nportional to the pressure of the surrounding gas.

The air delivered into\nan oven by the supply system to do the necessary work can be\nall fresh air (from a source outside the oven), or it can be\npartly fresh air and partly recirculated air from within the\noven. Only the fresh air supplied provides safety ventilation,\nand the amount of fresh air supplied must be equivalent to the\namount of oven exhaust air, to keep the system pressure in\nbalance. The amount of air discharged from the oven by the\nexhaust system is a fair indication of the safety ventilation,\nprovided the supply system and the exhaust system are de-\nsigned properly. The minimum amount of fresh air delivered\ninto the oven for safety ventilation is established by the\namount of solvent vaporized from the work in process. The\nmethod for determining the minimum volume of fresh air\nnecessary for safety ventilation is provided in A.11.6.7.\nMeasurement of Quantity of Air Exhausted from an Oven. A\nsimple method of determining the quantity of air exhausted\nfrom an oven is to measure the velocity of air through the\ndischarge duct by means of a velometer, an anemometer, a\npitot tube, or other suitable means. This measurement then is\nused to calculate the volume (cubic feet or cubic meters) of air\nper minute by multiplying the velocity in lineal feet per\nminute (lineal meters per minute) by the cross-sectional area\nof the exhaust duct in square feet (square meters). The tem-\nperature of the exhaust air also should be measured and the\ncalculated volume then corrected to 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). The result-\nant quantity of air is an indication of the volume exhausted\nfrom the oven, provided the exhaust air does not mix with air\nexternal to the oven. In many ovens, particularly those of the\ncontinuous type, the exhaust ducts have been incorrectly\nplaced in locations that allow outside air to enter the exhaust\nsystem together with the ventilation air exhausted from the\noven.\nExample: For a continuous oven, determine the parts of ex-\nhaust air at 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) and fresh air at 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C) that,\nwhen mixed, produce a resultant temperature of 242.5\u00b0F\n(117\u00b0C), given the following conditions:", "requirement_type": "mandatory", "source_document": "REG-NFPA 86.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-NFPA 86.pdf-2195", "section": "11.6.9.4", "title": "Extensive tests have been conducted by Underwrit-", "text": "A.11.6.9.4 Extensive tests have been conducted by Underwrit-\ners Laboratories Inc.

Some of\nthese burners utilize air as well. Stationary burners are at-\ntached to the furnace shell, cover, or both. Movable burners\nthat normally are not attached to the furnace are suspended\nfrom structural members outside a furnace door. These burn-\ners are manipulated from the operating floor, and the oxygen\nand fuel are introduced into the furnace through long, con-\ncentric pipes.\nConventional flame safeguards are impractical in conjunc-\ntion with oxy-fuel burners in arc furnaces because of the radio\nfrequency noise associated with the arcs. The electric arc is a\nreliable means of ignition for the burners, once the arc has\nbeen established. After the arc has been established, the high\ntemperatures inside an arc furnace cause the ignition of sig-\nnificant accumulations of oxygen and fuel.\nUsing oxygen to augment or to substitute for combustion\nair in industrial furnace heating systems presents new safety\nhazards for users acquainted only with air\u2013fuel burners.\nOne group of hazards arises from the exceptional reactivity\nof oxygen. It is a potent oxidizer; therefore, it accelerates\nburning rates. It also increases the flammability of substances\nthat generally are considered nonflammable in air. A fire fed\nby oxygen is difficult to extinguish.\nSpecial precautions are needed to prevent oxygen pipeline\nfires, that is, fires in which the pipe itself becomes the fuel. De-\nsigners and installers of gaseous oxygen piping should familiarize\nthemselves with standards and guidelines referenced in this stan-\ndard on pipe sizing, materials of construction, and sealing meth-\nods. Gaseous oxygen should flow at relatively low velocity in pipe-\nlines built of ferrous materials, because friction created by\nparticles swept through steel pipe at a high speed can ignite a\npipeline. For that reason, copper or copper-based alloy construc-\ntion is customary where the oxygen velocity needs to be high,\nsuch as in valves, valve trim areas, and orifices.\nOxygen pipelines should be cleaned scrupulously to rid\nthem of oil, grease, or any hydrocarbon residues before oxy-\ngen is introduced. Valves, controls, and piping elements that\ncome in contact with oxygen should be inspected and certi-\nfied as \u201cclean for oxygen service.\u201d Thread sealants, gaskets and\nseals, and valve trim should be oxygen-compatible; otherwise,\nthey could initiate or promote fires. Proven cleaning and in-\nspection methods are described in the Compressed Gas Asso-\nciation (CGA) publications listed in Annex M.\nFurnace operators and others who install or service oxygen\npiping and controls should be trained in the precautions and\nsafe practices for handling oxygen. For example, smoking or\nstriking a welding arc in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere\ncould start a fire. Gaseous oxygen has no odor and is invisible,\nso those locations in which there is a potential for leaks are off\nlimits to smokers and persons doing hot work. The location of\nsuch areas should be posted. Persons who have been in con-\ntact with oxygen should be aware that their clothing is ex-\ntremely flammable until it has been aired. Equipment or de-\nvices that contain oxygen should never be lubricated or\ncleaned with agents that are not approved for oxygen service.\nOxygen suppliers are sources of chemical material safety data\nsheets (MSDS) and other precautionary information for use in\nemployee training. Users are urged to review the safety require-\nments in this standard and to adopt the recommendations.\nAnother group of hazards is created by the nature of oxy-\nfuel and oxygen-enriched air flames. Because they are excep-\ntionally hot, these flames can damage burners, ruin work in\nprocess and furnace internals, and even destroy refractory in-\nsulation that was intended for air\u2013fuel heating. Oxygen\nburner systems and heating controls should have quick-acting,\nreliable means for controlling heat generation.\nAir that has been enriched with oxygen causes fuel to ignite\neasily, because added oxygen increases the flammability range\nof air\u2013fuel mixtures. Therefore, pre-ignition purging is critical\nwhere oxygen is used.\nOxygen is also a hazard for persons entering furnaces to\nperform inspections or repairs. Strict entry procedures for\nconfined spaces should be implemented.

A fluid heating system typically consists of a cen-\ntral heat exchanger to heat the thermal fluid. Firing can be by\nconventional gas or oil burners. The hot gases pass through a\nheat exchanger to heat the thermal fluid indirectly. The heat\nexchanger can be a separate, stand-alone unit or an integral part\nof the heater. Conventional water-tube boilers have been used as\nheaters, with thermal fluid replacing the water.\nIn addition to steam and water, special oils have been de-\nveloped for this type of application, with flash points of several\nhundred degrees Fahrenheit. For maximum thermal effi-\nciency, the oils are usually heated above their flash points,\nmaking an oil spill especially hazardous. Also, because of the\nhigh oil temperatures, it is usually necessary to keep the oil\ncirculating through the heat exchanger at all times to prevent\noil breakdown and tube fouling. Diesel-driven pumps or emer-\ngency generators are usually provided for this purpose in case\nof a power outage. Oil circulation can be needed for a period\nof time even after burner shutdown because of residual heat in\nthe heater.\nA.6.7.1.1\nSuitable relief valves should be provided where\nneeded.

The purpose of this standard is to establish a uni-\nform system of graphic symbols in vacuum technology.\nDefinition and Application. The graphic symbols are a\nshorthand used to show graphically the functioning and inter-\nconnections of vacuum components in a single-line schematic\nor flow diagram.\nA single-line diagram is one in which the graphic symbols\nare shown without regard to the actual physical location, size,\nor shape of the components.\nA symbol shall be considered as the aggregate of all its\nparts.\nThe orientation of a symbol on a drawing, including a mirror\nimage presentation, does not alter the meaning of the symbol.\nA symbol might be drawn to any scale that suits a particular\ndrawing.\nArrows should be omitted unless necessary for clarification.\nExplanation. The graphic symbols are divided into two\nseparate sections, general and specific symbols.\nWherever possible, the general symbol illustrates the func-\ntion or appearance of a component without regard to special\nfeatures.\nThe special symbols elaborate upon the general component\ncategories with individual symbols that illustrate in detail the spe-\ncial features of the component.

Steam extinguishes fire by the exclusion of air or\nthe reduction of the oxygen content of the atmosphere in a\nmanner similar to that of carbon dioxide or other inert gases.\nThe use of steam precedes other modern smothering systems.\nSteam is not a practical extinguishing agent except where a\nlarge steam supply is continuously available. The possible burn\nhazard should be considered in any steam extinguishing in-\nstallation. A visible cloud of condensed vapor, popularly de-\nscribed as steam, is incapable of extinguishment.\nAlthough many fires have been extinguished by steam, its\nuse often has been unsuccessful due to lack of understanding\nof its limitations. Except for specialized applications, other\ntypes of smothering systems are preferred in modern practice.\nNo complete standard covering steam smothering systems has\nyet been developed.\n86\u2013122\nOVENS AND FURNACES\n2015 Edition\n\n\nPage 126:\nOne pound of saturated steam at 212\u00b0F (100\u00b0C) and nor-", "requirement_type": "recommended", "source_document": "REG-NFPA 86.pdf", "page_number": "", "extraction_method": "rule_based"}, {"id": "rule-REG-NFPA 86.pdf-2992", "section": "26.75", "title": "ft3 (0.76 m3).", "text": "mal atmospheric pressure has a volume of 26.75 ft3 (0.76 m3).\nA larger percentage of steam is required to prevent combus-\ntion than in the case of other inert gases used for fire extin-\nguishment.
