$77.13 Construction or alteration re-quiring notice.

(a) Except as provided in Â§77.15, each
sponsor who proposes any of the fol-lowing construction or alteration shall
notify the Administrator in the form
and manner prescribed in Â§ 77.17:

(1) Any construction or alteration of
more than 200 feet in height above the
ground level at its site.

(2) Any construction or alteration of
greater height than an imaginary sur-face extending outward and upward at
one of the following slopes:

(i) 100 to 1 for a horizontal distance of
20,000 feet from the nearest point of the
nearest runway of each airport speci-fied in paragraph (a) (5) of this section
with at least one runway more than
3,200 feet in actual length, excluding
heliports.

(ii) 50 to 1 for a horizontal distance of
10,000 feet from the nearest point of the

Interstate Highways where over-crossings are designed for a minimum
of 17 feet vertical distance, 15 feet for
any other public roadway, 10 feet or

14 CFR Ch. I (1-1-11 Edition)

the height of the highest mobile object
that would normally traverse the road,
whichever is greater, for a private
road, 23 feet for a railroad, and for a
waterway or any other traverse way
not previously mentioned, an amount
equal to the height of the highest mo-bile object that would normally tra-verse it, would exceed a standard of
paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section.

(4) When requested by the FAA, any
construction or alteration that would
be in an instrument approach area (de-fined in the FAA standards governing
instrument approach procedures) and
available information indicates it
might exceed a standard of subpart C of
this part.

(5) Any construction or alteration on
any of the following airports (including
heliports):

(i) An airport that is available for
public use and is listed in the Airport
Directory of the current Airman's In-formation Manual or in either the
Alaska or Pacific Airman's Guide and
Chart Supplement.

(ii) An airport under construction,

Â§77.15 Construction or alteration not
requiring notice.

No person is required to notify the
Administrator for any of the following
construction or alteration:

(a) Any object that would be shielded
by existing structures of a permanent
and substantial character or by natural
terrain or topographic features of equal
or greater height, and would be located
in the congested area of a city, town,
or settlement where it is evident be-
yond all reasonable doubt that the
structure so shielded will not adversely
affect safety in air navigation.

(b) Any antenna structure of 20 feet
or less in height except one that would
increase the height of another antenna
structure.

(c) Any air navigation facility, air-
port visual approach or landing aid,
aircraft arresting device, or meteoro-
logical device, of a type approved by
the Administrator, or an appropriate
military service on military airports,
the location and height of which is
fixed by its functional purpose.

(d) Any construction or alteration for
which notice is required by any other
FAA regulation.

[Doc. No. 1882, 30 FR 1839, Feb. 10, 1965, as
amended by Amdt. 77-5, 33 FR 5257, Apr. 2,
1968; Amdt. 77-9, 36 FR 5970, Apr. 1, 1971]

Â§77.17 Form and time of notice.

(a) Each person who is required to
notify the Administrator under
Â§77.13(a) shall send one executed form
set (four copies) of FAA Form 7460-1,
Notice of Proposed Construction or Al-
teration, to the Manager, Air Traffic
Division, FAA Regional Office having
jurisdiction over the area within which
the construction or alteration will be
located. Copies of FAA Form 7460-1
may be obtained from the headquarters
of the Federal Aviation Administration
and the regional offices.

(b) The notice required under
Â§77.13(a) (1) through (4) must be sub-
mitted at least 30 days before the ear-
lier of the following dates:

Â§ 77.17

(1) The date the proposed construc-
tion or alteration is to begin.

(2) The date an application for a con-
struction permit is to be filed.

However, a notice relating to proposed
construction or alteration that is sub-
ject to the licensing requirements of
the Federal Communications Act may
be sent to FAA at the same time the
application for construction is filed
with the Federal Communications
Commission, or at any time before that
filing.

(c) A proposed structure or an alter-
ation to an existing structure that ex-
ceeds 2,000 feet in height above the
ground will be presumed to be a hazard
to air navigation and to result in an in-
efficient utilization of airspace and the
applicant has the burden of overcoming
that presumption. Each notice sub-
mitted under the pertinent provisions
of this part 77 proposing a structure in
excess of 2,000 feet above ground, or an
alteration that will make an existing
structure exceed that height, must
contain a detailed showing, directed to
meeting this burden. Only in excep-
tional cases, where the FAA concludes
that a clear and compelling showing
has been made that it would not result
in an inefficient utilization of the air-
space and would not result in a hazard
to air navigation, will a determination
of no hazard be issued.

(d) In the case of an emergency in-
volving essential public services, public
health, or public safety that requires
immediate construction or alteration,
the 30-day requirement in paragraph
(b) of this section does not apply and
the notice may be sent by telephone,
telegraph, or other expeditious means,
with an executed FAA Form 7460-1 sub-
mitted within 5 days thereafter. Out-
side normal business hours, emergency
notices by telephone or telegraph may
be submitted to the nearest FAA
Flight Service Station.

(e) Each person who is required to no-
tify the Administrator by paragraph
(b) or (c) of Â§77.13, or both, shall send
an executed copy of FAA Form 117-1,
Notice of Progress of Construction or
Alteration, to the Manager, Air Traffic

(a) The FAA acknowledges in writing
the receipt of each notice submitted
under Â§ 77.13(a).

(b) If the construction or alteration
proposed in a notice is one for which
lighting or marking standards are pre-
scribed in the FAA Advisory Circular
AC 70/7460-1, entitled "Obstruction
Marking and Lighting," the acknowl-
edgment contains a statement to that
effect and information on how the
structure should be marked and lighted
in accordance with the manual.

(c) The acknowledgment states that
an aeronautical study of the proposed
construction or alteration has resulted
in a determination that the construc-
tion or alteration:

(1) Would not exceed any standard of
subpart C and would not be a hazard to
air navigation;

(2) Would exceed a standard of sub-
part C but would not be a hazard to air
navigation; or

(3) Would exceed a standard of sub-
part C and further aeronautical study
is necessary to determine whether it
would be a hazard to air navigation,
that the sponsor may request within 30
days that further study, and that,
pending completion of any further
study, it is presumed the construction
or alteration would be a hazard to air
navigation.

Subpart C-Obstruction Standards

Â§77.21 Scope.

(a) This subpart establishes stand-
ards for determining obstructions to
air navigation. It applies to existing
and proposed manmade objects, objects
of natural growth, and terrain. The
standards apply to the use of navigable
airspace by aircraft and to existing air

14 CFR Ch. I (1-1-11 Edition)

navigation facilities, such as an air
navigation aid, airport, Federal air-
way, instrument approach or departure
procedure, or approved off-airway
route. Additionally, they apply to a
planned facility or use, or a change in
an existing facility or use, if a proposal
therefor is on file with the Federal
Aviation Administration or an appro-

priate military service on the date the
notice required by Â§ 77.13(a) is filed.

(b) At those airports having defined
runways with specially prepared hard
surfaces, the primary surface for each
such runway extends 200 feet beyond
each end of the runway. At those air-
ports having defined strips or pathways
that are used regularly for the taking
off and landing of aircraft and have
been designated by appropriate author-
ity as runways, but do not have spe-
cially prepared hard surfaces, each end
of the primary surface for each such
runway shall coincide with the cor-
responding end of the runway. At those
airports, excluding seaplane bases, hav-
ing a defined landing and takeoff area
with no defined pathways for the land-
ing and taking off of aircraft, a deter-
mination shall be made as to which
portions of the landing and takeoff
area are regularly used as landing and
takeoff pathways. Those pathways so
determined shall be considered run-
ways and an appropriate primary sur-
face as defined in Â§77.25(c) will be con-
sidered as being longitudinally cen-
tered on each runway so determined,
and each end of that primary surface
shall coincide with the corresponding
end of that runway.

(c) The standards in this subpart
apply to the effect of construction or
alteration proposals upon an airport if,
at the time of filing of the notice re-
quired by Â§77.13(a), that airport is-

(1) Available for public use and is
listed in the Airport Directory of the
current Airman's Information Manual
or in either the Alaska or Pacific Air-
man's Guide and Chart Supplement; or

(2) A planned or proposed airport or
an airport under construction, that is
the subject of a notice or proposal on
file with the Federal Aviation Admin-
istration, and, except for military air-
ports, it is clearly indicated that that
airport will be available for public use;
or,

Â§77.23 Standards for determining ob-
structions.

(a) An existing object, including a
mobile object, is, and a future object
would be, an obstruction to air naviga-
tion if it is of greater height than any
of the following heights or surfaces:

(1) A height of 500 feet above ground
level at the site of the object.

(2) A height that is 200 feet above
ground level or above the established
airport elevation, whichever is higher,
within 3 nautical miles of the estab-
lished reference point of an airport, ex-
cluding heliports, with its longest run-
way more than 3,200 feet in actual
length, and that height increases in the
proportion of 100 feet for each addi-
tional nautical mile of distance from
the airport up to a maximum of 500
feet.

(3) A height within a terminal obsta-
cle clearance area, including an initial
approach segment, a departure area,
and a circling approach area, which
would result in the vertical distance
between any point on the object and an
established minimum instrument
flight altitude within that area or seg-
ment to be less than the required ob-
stacle clearance.

(4) A height within an en route obsta-
cle clearance area, including turn and
termination areas, of a Federal airway
or approved off-airway route, that
would increase the minimum obstacle
clearance altitude.

(5) The surface of a takeoff and land-
ing area of an airport or any imaginary
surface established under Â§ 77.25, Â§77.28,
or Â§ 77.29. However, no part of the take-
off or landing area itself will be consid-
ered an obstruction.

(b) Except for traverse ways on or
near an airport with an operative
ground traffic control service, fur-
nished by an air traffic control tower
or by the airport management and co-
ordinated with the air traffic control
service, the standards of paragraph (a)
of this section apply to traverse ways
used or to be used for the passage of

Â§ 77.25

mobile objects only after the heights of
these traverse ways are increased by:

(1) Seventeen feet for an Interstate
Highway that is part of the National
System of Military and Interstate
Highways where overcrossings are de-
signed for a minimum of 17 feet
vertical distance.

(2) Fifteen feet for any other public
roadway.

(3) Ten feet or the height of the high-
est mobile object that would normally
traverse the road, whichever is greater,
for a private road.

(4) Twenty-three feet for a railroad,
and,

(5) For a waterway or any other tra-
verse way not previously mentioned,
an amount equal to the height of the
highest mobile object that would nor-
mally traverse it.

Â§77.25 Civil airport imaginary sur-
faces.

The following civil airport imaginary
surfaces are established with relation
to the airport and to each runway. The
size of each such imaginary surface is
based on the category of each runway
according to the type of approach
available or planned for that runway.
The slope and dimensions of the ap-
proach surface applied to each end of a
runway are determined by the most
precise approach existing or planned
for that runway end.

(a) Horizontal surface. A horizontal
plane 150 feet above the established air-
port elevation, the perimeter of which
is constructed by swinging arcs of spec-
ified radii from the center of each end
of the primary surface of each runway
of each airport and connecting the ad-
jacent arcs by lines tangent to those
arcs. The radius of each arc is:

(1) 5,000 feet for all runways des-
ignated as utility or visual;

(2) 10,000 feet for all other runways.
The radius of the arc specified for each
end of a runway will have the same ar-
ithmetical value. That value will be
the highest determined for either end
of the runway. When a 5,000-foot arc is
encompassed by tangents connecting
two adjacent 10,000-foot arcs, the 5,000-
foot arc shall be disregarded on the
construction of the perimeter of the
horizontal surface.

Â§77.27
(b) *Conical surface.* A surface extend-
ing outward and upward from the pe-
riphery of the horizontal surface at a
slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance
of 4,000 feet.
(c) *Primary surface.* A surface longitu-
dinally centered on a runway. When
the runway has a specially prepared
hard surface, the primary surface ex-
tends 200 feet beyond each end of that
runway; but when the runway has no
specially prepared hard surface, or
planned hard surface, the primary sur-
face ends at each end of that runway.
The elevation of any point on the pri-
mary surface is the same as the ele-
vation of the nearest point on the run-
way centerline. The width of a primary
surface is:
(1) 250 feet for utility runways having
only visual approaches.
(2) 500 feet for utility runways having
nonprecision instrument approaches.
(3) For other than utility runways
the width is:
(i) 500 feet for visual runways having
only visual approaches.
(ii) 500 feet for nonprecision instru-
ment runways having visibility mini-
mums greater than three-fourths stat-
ute mile.
(iii) 1,000 feet for a nonprecision in-
strument runway having a nonpreci-
sion instrument approach with visi-
bility minimums as low as three-
fourths of a statute mile, and for preci-
sion instrument runways.
The width of the primary surface of a
runway will be that width prescribed in
this section for the most precise ap-
proach existing or planned for either
end of that runway.
(d) *Approach surface.* A surface longi-
tudinally centered on the extended
runway centerline and extending out-
ward and upward from each end of the
primary surface. An approach surface
is applied to each end of each runway
based upon the type of approach avail-
able or planned for that runway end.
(1) The inner edge of the approach
surface is the same width as the pri-
mary surface and it expands uniformly
to a width of:
(i) 1,250 feet for that end of a utility
runway with only visual approaches;
(ii) 1,500 feet for that end of a runway
other than a utility runway with only
visual approaches;

14 CFR Ch. I (1-1-11 Edition)
(iii) 2,000 feet for that end of a utility
runway with a nonprecision instru-
ment approach;
(iv) 3,500 feet for that end of a non-
precision instrument runway other
than utility, having visibility mini-
mums greater than three-fourths of a
statute mile;
(v) 4,000 feet for that end of a non-
precision instrument runway, other
than utility, having a nonprecision in-
strument approach with visibility
minimums as low as three-fourths stat-
ute mile; and
(vi) 16,000 feet for precision instru-
ment runways.
(2) The approach surface extends for
a horizontal distance of:
(i) 5,000 feet at a slope of 20 to 1 for
all utility and visual runways;
(ii) 10,000 feet at a slope of 34 to 1 for
all nonprecision instrument runways
other than utility; and,
(iii) 10,000 feet at a slope of 50 to 1
with an additional 40,000 feet at a slope
of 40 to 1 for all precision instrument
runways.
(3) The outer width of an approach
surface to an end of a runway will be
that width prescribed in this sub-
section for the most precise approach
existing or planned for that runway
end.
(e) *Transitional surface.* These sur-
faces extend outward and upward at
right angles to the runway centerline
and the runway centerline extended at
a slope of 7 to 1 from the sides of the
primary surface and from the sides of
the approach surfaces. Transitional
surfaces for those portions of the preci-
sion approach surface which project
through and beyond the limits of the
conical surface, extend a distance of
5,000 feet measured horizontally from
the edge of the approach surface and at
right angles to the runway centerline.

operated by an armed force of the
United States.

(1) *Inner horizontal surface*. A plane is
oval in shape at a height of 150 feet
above the established airfield ele-
vation. The plane is constructed by
scribing an arc with a radius of 7,500
feet about the centerline at the end of
each runway and interconnecting these
arcs with tangents.

(2) *Conical surface*. A surface extend-
ing from the periphery of the inner
horizontal surface outward and upward
at a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal dis-
tance of 7,000 feet to a height of 500 feet
above the established airfield ele-
vation.

(3) *Outer horizontal surface*. A plane,
located 500 feet above the established
airfield elevation, extending outward
from the outer periphery of the conical
surface for a horizontal distance of
30,000 feet.

(b) Related to runways. These surfaces
apply to all military airports.

(1) *Primary surface*. A surface located
on the ground or water longitudinally
centered on each runway with the same
length as the runway. The width of the
primary surface for runways is 2,000
feet. However, at established bases
where substantial construction has
taken place in accordance with a pre-
vious lateral clearance criteria, the
2,000-foot width may be reduced to the
former criteria.

(2) *Clear zone surface*. A surface lo-
cated on the ground or water at each
end of the primary surface, with a
length of 1,000 feet and the same width
as the primary surface.

(3) *Approach clearance surface*. An in-
clined plane, symmetrical about the
runway centerline extended, beginning
200 feet beyond each end of the primary
surface at the centerline elevation of
the runway end and extending for 50,000
feet. The slope of the approach clear-
ance surface is 50 to 1 along the runway
centerline extended until it reaches an
elevation of 500 feet above the estab-
lished airport elevation. It then con-
tinues horizontally at this elevation to
a point 50,000 feet from the point of be-
ginning. The width of this surface at
the runway end is the same as the pri-
mary surface, it flares uniformly, and
the width at 50,000 is 16,000 feet.

Â§ 77.31

(4) *Transitional surfaces*. These sur-
faces connect the primary surfaces, the
first 200 feet of the clear zone surfaces,
and the approach clearance surfaces to
the inner horizontal surface, conical
surface, outer horizontal surface or
other transitional surfaces. The slope
of the transitional surface is 7 to 1 out-
ward and upward at right angles to the
runway centerline.

Â§77.29 Airport imaginary surfaces for
heliports.

(a) *Heliport primary surface*. The area
of the primary surface coincides in size
and shape with the designated take-off
and landing area of a heliport. This
surface is a horizontal plane at the ele-
vation of the established heliport ele-
vation.

(b) *Heliport approach surface*. The ap-
proach surface begins at each end of
the heliport primary surface with the
same width as the primary surface, and
extends outward and upward for a hori-
zontal distance of 4,000 feet where its
width is 500 feet. The slope of the ap-
proach surface is 8 to 1 for civil heli-
ports and 10 to 1 for military heliports.

(c) *Heliport transitional surfaces* These
surfaces extend outward and upward
from the lateral boundaries of the heli-
port primary surface and from the ap-
proach surfaces at a slope of 2 to 1 for
a distance of 250 feet measured hori-
zontally from the centerline of the pri-
mary and approach surfaces.

Â§ 77.33
reviewed and any possible changes in
those operations and procedures and in
the construction proposal that would
eliminate or alleviate the conflicting
demands are ascertained.
(b) The conclusion of a study made
under this subpart is normally a deter-
mination as to whether the specific
proposal studied would be a hazard to
air navigation.

$77.33 Initiation of studies.
(a) An aeronautical study is con-
ducted by the FAA:
(1) Upon the request of the sponsor or
any construction or alteration for
which a notice is submitted under sub-
part B of this part, unless that con-
struction or alteration would be lo-
cated within an antenna farm area es-
tablished under subpart F of this part;
or
(2) Whenever the FAA determines it
appropriate.
[Doc. No. 1882, 30 FR 1839, Feb. 10, 1965, as

$77.35 Aeronautical studies.
(a) The Regional Manager, Air Traf-
fic Division of the region in which the
proposed construction or alteration
would be located, or his designee, con-
ducts the aeronautical study of the ef-
fect of the proposal upon the operation
of air navigation facilities and the safe
and efficient utilization of the navi-
gable airspace. This study may include
the physical and electromagnetic radi-
ation effect the proposal may have on
the operation of an air navigation fa-
cility.
(b) To the extent considered nec-
essary, the Regional Manager, Air
Traffic Division or his designee:
(1) Solicits comments from all inter-
ested persons;
(2) Explores objections to the pro-
posal and attempts to develop rec-
ommendations for adjustment of avia-
tion requirements that would accom-
modate the proposed construction or
alteration;
(3) Examines possible revisions of the
proposal that would eliminate the ex-

14 CFR Ch. I (1-1-11 Edition)
ceeding of the standards in subpart C of
this part; and
(4) Convenes a meeting with all inter-
ested persons for the purpose of gath-
ering all facts relevant to the effect of
the proposed construction or alteration
on the safe and efficient utilization of
the navigable airspace.
(c) The Regional Manager, Air Traf-
fic Division or his designee issues a de-
termination as to whether the proposed
construction or alteration would be a
hazard to air navigation and sends cop-
ies to all known interested persons.
This determination is final unless a pe-
tition for review is granted under
Â§ 77.37.
(d) If the sponsor revises his proposal
to eliminate exceeding of the standards
of subpart C of this part, or withdraws
it, the Regional Manager, Air Traffic
Division, or his designee, terminates
the study and notifies all known inter-
ested persons.

Â§77.37 Discretionary review.
(a) The sponsor of any proposed con-
struction or alteration or any person
who stated a substantial aeronautical
objection to it in an aeronautical
study, or any person who has a sub-
stantial aeronautical objection to it
but was not given an opportunity to
state it, may petition the Adminis-
trator, within 30 days after issuance of
the determination under Â§77.19 or
Â§77.35 or revision or extension of the
determination under Â§77.39(c), for a re-
view of the determination, revision, or
extension. This paragraph does not
apply to any acknowledgment issued
under Â§ 77.19(c)(1).
(b) The petition must be in triplicate
and contain a full statement of the
basis upon which it is made.
(c) The Administrator examines each
petition and decides whether a review
will be made and, if so, whether it will
be:
(1) A review on the basis of written
materials, including study of a report
by the Regional Manager, Air Traffic
Division of the aeronautical study,
briefs, and related submissions by any
interested party, and other relevant

Â§77.39 Effective period of determina-
tion of no hazard.

(a) Unless it is otherwise extended,
revised, or terminated, each final de-termination of no hazard made under
this subpart or subpart B or E of this
part expires 18 months after its effec-tive date, regardless of whether the
proposed construction or alteration has
been started, or on the date the pro-posed construction or alteration is
abandoned, whichever is earlier.

(b) In any case, including a deter-mination to which paragraph (d) of this
section applies, where the proposed
construction or alteration has not been
started during the applicable period by
actual structural work, such as the
laying of a foundation, but not includ-ing excavation, any interested person
may, at least 15 days before the date
the final determination expires, peti-tion the FAA official who issued the

Subpart EâRules of Practice for
Hearings Under Subpart D

Â§77.41 Scope.

This subpart applies to hearings held
by the FAA under titles I, III, and X of
the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49
U.S.C. subchapters I, III, and X), on
proposed construction or alteration
that affects the use of navigable air-space.

Â§77.43 Nature of hearing.

Sections 4, 5, 7, and 8 of the Adminis-trative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 1003,
1004, 1006, and 1007) do not apply to
hearings held on proposed construction
or alteration to determine its effect on
the safety of aircraft and the efficient
use of navigable airspace because those
hearings are factfinding in nature. As a
factfinding procedure, each hearing is
nonadversary and there are no formal
pleadings or adverse parties.

Â§77.45 Presiding officer.

(a) If, under Â§ 79.37, the Administrator
grants a public hearing on any pro-posed construction or alteration cov-ered by this part, the Director, Air
Traffic Operations Service designates
an FAA employee to be the presiding
officer at the hearing.

(b) The presiding officer may:

(1) Give notice of the date and loca-tion of the hearing and any prehearing
conference that may be held;

(2) Administer oaths and affirma-tions;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 12

Â§77.47

(3) Examine witnesses;
(4) Issue subpoenas and take deposi-
tions or have them taken;
(5) Obtain, in the form of a public
record, all pertinent and relevant facts
relating to the subject matter of the
hearing;
(6) Rule, with the assistance of the
legal officer, upon the admissibility of
evidence;
(7) Regulate the course and conduct
of the hearing; and
(8) Designate parties to the hearing
and revoke those designations.

[Doc. No. 1882, 30 FR 1839, Feb. 10, 1965, as
amended by Amdt. 77-11, 54 FR 39292, Sept.
25, 1989]

$77.47 Legal officer.

The Chief Counsel designates a mem-
ber of his staff to serve as legal officer
at each hearing under this subpart. The
legal officer may examine witnesses
and assist and advise the presiding offi-
cer on questions of evidence or other
legal questions arising during the hear-
ing.

[Doc. No. 1882, 30 FR 1839, Feb. 10, 1965, as
amended at 38 FR 26444, Sept. 17, 1973]

Â§77.49 Notice of hearing.

In designating a time and place for a
hearing under this subpart the pre-
siding officer considers the needs of the
FAA and the convenience of the parties
and witnesses. The time and place of
each hearing is published in the "No-
tices" section of the FEDERAL REGISTER
before the date of the hearing, unless
the notice is impractical or unneces-
sary.

Â§77.51 Parties to the hearing.

The presiding officer designates the
following as parties to the hearingâ
(a) The proponent of the proposed
construction or alteration.

(b) Those persons whose activities
would be substantially affected by the
proposed construction or alteration.

$77.53 Prehearing conference.

(a) The presiding officer may, in his
discretion, hold a prehearing con-
ference with the parties to the hearing
and the legal officer before the hearing.

(b) At the direction of the presiding
officer, each party to a prehearing con-

14 CFR Ch. I (1-1-11 Edition)

ference shall submit a brief written
statement of the evidence he intends to
provide through his witnesses and by
questioning other witnesses at the
hearing, and shall provide enough cop-
ies of the statement so that the pre-
siding officer may keep three for the
FAA and give one to each other party.

(c) At the prehearing conference, the
presiding officer reduces and simplifies
the subject matter of the hearing so far
as possible and advises the parties of
the probable order of presenting the
evidence.

$77.55 Examination of witnesses.

(a) Each witness at a hearing under
this subpart shall, after being sworn by
the presiding officer, give his testi-
mony under oath.

(b) The party for whom a witness,
other than an employee of the FAA, is
testifying shall examine that witness.
After that examination, other parties
to the hearing may examine the wit-
ness, in the order fixed by the presiding
officer. The presiding officer and the
legal officer may then examine the wit-
ness. The presiding officer may grant
any party an additional opportunity to
examine any witness, if that party ade-
quately justifies the additional exam-
ination.

(c) The legal officer examines each
FAA employee who is a witness, before
the other parties examine him. After
that examination, the order prescribed
in paragraph (b) of this section applies.
An FAA employee may testify only as
to facts within his personal knowledge
and the application of FAA regula-
tions, standards, and policies.

Â§77.57 Evidence.

(a) The presiding officer receives all
testimony and exhibits that are rel-
evant to the issues of the hearing. So
far as possible, each party shall submit
enough copies of his exhibits that the
presiding officer may keep three copies
for the FAA and give one to each other
party.

(b) The presiding officer excludes any
testimony that is irrelevant, unduly
repetitious, or consists of statements
made during an aeronautical study in
an effort to reconcile or compromise
aviation or construction or alteration
requirements. A party to the hearing

568

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT
may object to the admission of evi-
dence only on the ground that it is ir-
relevant.

Â§77.59 Subpoenas of witnesses and ex-
hibits.

(a) The presiding officer of a hearing
may issue subpoenas for any witness or
exhibit that he determines may be ma-
terial and relevant to the issues of the
hearing. So far as possible, each party
to the hearing shall provide the wit-
nesses and exhibits that he intends to
present at the hearing.

(b) If any party to the hearing is un-
able to provide his necessary witnesses
and exhibits, he shall advise the pre-
siding officer far enough in advance
that the presiding officer can deter-
mine whether he should issue sub-
poenas for the desired witnesses or ex-
hibits.

Â§77.61 Revision of construction or al-
teration proposal.

(a) The sponsor of any proposed con-
struction or alteration covered by this
part may revise his proposal at any
time before or during the hearing. If he
revises it, the presiding officer decides
whether the revision affects the pro-
posal to the extent that he should send
it to the Administrator for a redeter-
mination of the need for a hearing.

(b) If the presiding officer decides
that it does not need to be resubmitted
to the Administrator, he advises the
parties of the revised proposal and
takes the action necessary to allow all
parties to effectively participate in the
hearing on the revised proposal. With-
out limiting his discretion, the pre-
siding officer may recess and reconvene
the hearing, or hold another prehearing
conference.

$77.63 Record of hearing.

(a) Each hearing is recorded verbatim
by an official reporter under an FAA
contract. The transcript, and all exhib-
its, become a part of the record of the
hearing.

(b) Any person may buy a copy of the
transcript of the hearing from the re-
porter at the price fixed for it.

(c) The presiding officer may allow
any party to withdraw an original doc-
ument if he submits authenticated cop-
ies of it.

Â§ 77.69

(d) Any person may buy, from the
FAA, photostatic copies of any exhibit
by paying the copying costs.

(e) A change in the official transcript
of a hearing may be made only if it in-
volves an error of substance. Any rec-
ommendation to correct the transcript
must be filed with the presiding officer
within 5 days after the hearing closes.
The presiding officer reviews each re-
quest for a correction to the extent he
considers appropriate and shall make
any revisions that he finds appropriate
as a result of that review.

$77.65 Recommendations by parties.

Within 20 days after the mailing of
the record of hearing by the official re-
porter, or as otherwise directed by the
presiding officer, each party may sub-
mit to the presiding officer five copies
of his recommendations for a final de-
cision to be made by the Adminis-
trator.

$77.67 Final decision of the Adminis-
trator.

After reviewing the evidence relevant
to the questions of fact in a hearing,
including the official transcript and
the exhibits, The Administrator re-
solves all these questions, based on the
weight of evidence, and makes his de-
termination, stating the basis and rea-
sons for it. He then issues an appro-
priate order to be served on each of the
parties.

569

Â§77.69 Limitations on appearance and
representation.

(a) A former officer or employee of
the FAA may not appear on behalf of,

Subpart F-Establishment of
Antenna Farm Areas

$77.71 Scope.

(a) This subpart establishes antenna
farm areas in which antenna structures
may be grouped to localize their effect
on the use of navigable airspace.

(b) It is the policy of the FAA to en-
courage the use of antenna farms and
the single structure-multiple antenna
concept for radio and television towers
whenever possible. In considering pro-
posals for establishing antenna farm
areas, it considers as far as possible the
revision of aeronautical procedures and
operations to accommodate antenna
structures that will fulfill broadcasting
requirements.

Â§77.73 General provisions.

(a) An antenna farm area consists of
a specified geographical location with
established dimensions of area and
height, where antenna towers with a
common impact on aviation may be
grouped. Each such area is established
by appropriate rule making action.

(b) Each proposal for an antenna
farm area is evaluated on the basis of
its effect on the use of navigable air-
space. The views of the Federal Com-
munications Commission are requested
on the effect that each establishment
of an antenna farm area would have on
its statutory responsibilities. Any
views submitted by it are fully consid-
ered before the antenna farm concerned
is established. If the Commission ad-
vises that the establishment of any
proposed antenna farm area would
interfere with its statutory responsi-
bility, the proposed area is not estab-
lished.

(c) The establishment of an antenna
farm area is considered whenever it is
proposed by:

14 CFR Ch. I (1-1-11 Edition)

(1) The FAA;

(2) The Federal Communications
Commission;

(3) The sponsor of a proposed antenna
tower; or

(4) Any other person having a sub-
stantial interest in a proposed antenna
tower.

Pt. 77, Nt.

construction or alteration or the date an ap-
plication for a construction permit is filed,
whichever is earliest.

(c) If you propose construction or alter-
ation that is also subject to the licensing re-
quirements of the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), you must submit notice
to the FAA on or before the date that the ap-
plication is filed with the FCC.

(d) If you propose construction or alter-
ation to an existing structure that exceeds
2,000 ft. in height above ground level (AGL),
the FAA presumes it to be a hazard to air
navigation that results in an inefficient use
of airspace. You must include details ex-
plaining both why the proposal would not
constitute a hazard to air navigation and
why it would not cause an inefficient use of
airspace.

(e) The 45-day advance notice requirement
is waived if immediate construction or alter-
ation is required because of an emergency in-
volving essential public services, public
health, or public safety. You may provide no-
tice to the FAA by any available, expedi-
tious means. You must file a completed FAA
Form 7460-1 within 5 days of the initial no-
tice to the FAA. Outside normal business
hours, the nearest flight service station will
accept emergency notices.

$77.9 Construction or alteration requiring
notice.

for a minimum of 17 feet vertical distance, 15
feet for any other public roadway, 10 feet or

14 CFR Ch. I (1-1-11 Edition)

the height of the highest mobile object that
would normally traverse the road, whichever
is greater, for a private road, 23 feet for a
railroad, and for a waterway or any other

(d) If the construction or alteration is dis-
mantled or destroyed, you must submit no-
tice to the FAA within 5 days after the con-
struction or alteration is dismantled or de-
stroyed.

Subpart CâStandards for Determining
Obstructions to Air Navigation or
Navigational Aids or Facilities

Â§77.13 Applicability.

This subpart describes the standards used
for determining obstructions to air naviga-
tion, navigational aids, or navigational fa-
cilities. These standards apply to the fol-
lowing:

(a) Any object of natural growth, terrain,
or permanent or temporary construction or
alteration, including equipment or materials
used and any permanent or temporary appa-
ratus.

(b) The alteration of any permanent or
temporary existing structure by a change in
its height, including appurtenances, or lat-
eral dimensions, including equipment or ma-
terial used therein.

$77.15 Scope.

(a) This subpart describes standards used
to determine obstructions to air navigation
that may affect the safe and efficient use of
navigable airspace and the operation of
planned or existing air navigation and com-
munication facilities. Such facilities include
air navigation aids, communication equip-
ment, airports, Federal airways, instrument
approach or departure procedures, and ap-
proved off-airway routes.

(b) Objects that are considered obstruc-
tions under the standards described in this
subpart are presumed hazards to air naviga-
tion unless further aeronautical study con-
cludes that the object is not a hazard. Once
further aeronautical study has been initi-
ated, the FAA will use the standards in this
subpart, along with FAA policy and guidance
material, to determine if the object is a haz-
ard to air navigation.

(c) The FAA will apply these standards
with reference to an existing airport facility,
and airport proposals received by the FAA,
or the appropriate military service, before it
issues a final determination.

(d) For airports having defined runways
with specially prepared hard surfaces, the
primary surface for each runway extends 200
feet beyond each end of the runway. For air-
ports having defined strips or pathways used
regularly for aircraft takeoffs and landings,
and designated runways, without specially
prepared hard surfaces, each end of the pri-
mary surface for each such runway shall co-
incide with the corresponding end of the run-
way. At airports, excluding seaplane bases,
having a defined landing and takeoff area
with no defined pathways for aircraft take-
offs and landings, a determination must be

Pt. 77, Nt.

made as to which portions of the landing and
takeoff area are regularly used as landing
and takeoff pathways. Those determined
pathways must be considered runways, and
an appropriate primary surface as defined in
Â§77.19 will be considered as longitudinally
centered on each such runway. Each end of
that primary surface must coincide with the
corresponding end of that runway.

(e) The standards in this subpart apply to
construction or alteration proposals on an
airport (including heliports and seaplane
bases with marked lanes) if that airport is
one of the following before the issuance of
the final determination:

(1) Available for public use and is listed in
the Airport/Facility Directory, Supplement
Alaska, or Supplement Pacific of the U.S.
Government Flight Information Publica-
tions; or

(2) A planned or proposed airport or an air-
port under construction of which the FAA
has received actual notice, except DOD air-
ports, where there is a clear indication the
airport will be available for public use; or,

(3) An airport operated by a Federal agen-
cy or the DOD; or,

(4) An airport that has at least one FAA-
approved instrument approach.

$77.17 Obstruction standards.

(a) An existing object, including a mobile
object, is, and a future object would be an
obstruction to air navigation if it is of great-
er height than any of the following heights
or surfaces:

(1) A height of 499 feet AGL at the site of
the object.

(2) A height that is 200 feet AGL, or above
the established airport elevation, whichever
is higher, within 3 nautical miles of the es-
tablished reference point of an airport, ex-
cluding heliports, with its longest runway
more than 3,200 feet in actual length, and
that height increases in the proportion of 100
feet for each additional nautical mile from
the airport up to a maximum of 499 feet.

(3) A height within a terminal obstacle
clearance area, including an initial approach
segment, a departure area, and a circling ap-
proach area, which would result in the
vertical distance between any point on the
object and an established minimum instru-
ment flight altitude within that area or seg-
ment to be less than the required obstacle
clearance.

(4) A height within an en route obstacle
clearance area, including turn and termi-
nation areas, of a Federal Airway or ap-
proved off-airway route, that would increase
the minimum obstacle clearance altitude.

(5) The surface of a takeoff and landing
area of an airport or any imaginary surface
established under Â§77.19, 77.21, or 77.23. How-
ever, no part of the takeoff or landing area
itself will be considered an obstruction.

573

## Page 18

Pt. 77, Nt.

(b) Except for traverse ways on or near an airport with an operative ground traffic con- trol service furnished by an airport traffic control tower or by the airport management and coordinated with the air traffic control service, the standards of paragraph (a) of this section apply to traverse ways used or to be used for the passage of mobile objects only after the heights of these traverse ways are increased by:

(1) 17 feet for an Interstate Highway that is part of the National System of Military and Interstate Highways where overcrossings are designed for a minimum of 17 feet vertical distance.

(2) 15 feet for any other public roadway.

(3) 10 feet or the height of the highest mo- bile object that would normally traverse the road, whichever is greater, for a private road.

(4) 23 feet for a railroad.

(5) For a waterway or any other traverse way not previously mentioned, an amount equal to the height of the highest mobile ob- ject that would normally traverse it.

Â§77.19 Civil airport imaginary surfaces.

The following civil airport imaginary sur- faces are established with relation to the air- port and to each runway. The size of each such imaginary surface is based on the cat- egory of each runway according to the type of approach available or planned for that runway. The slope and dimensions of the ap- proach surface applied to each end of a run- way are determined by the most precise ap- proach procedure existing or planned for that runway end.

(a) Horizontal surface. A horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport ele- vation, the perimeter of which is constructed by SW.inging arcs of a specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway of each airport and con- necting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is:

(1) 5,000 feet for all runways designated as utility or visual;

(2) 10,000 feet for all other runways. The ra- dius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value. That value will be the highest deter- mined for either end of the runway. When a 5,000-foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two adjacent 10,000-foot arcs, the 5,000-foot arc shall be disregarded on the con- struction of the perimeter of the horizontal surface.

(b) Conical surface. A surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.

(c) Primary surface. A surface longitu- dinally centered on a runway. When the run- way has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway; but when the run-

14 CFR Ch. I (1-1-11 Edition)

way has no specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface ends at each end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway center- line. The width of the primary surface is:

(1) 250 feet for utility runways having only visual approaches.

(2) 500 feet for utility runways having non- precision instrument approaches.

(3) For other than utility runways, the width is:

(i) 500 feet for visual runways having only visual approaches.

(ii) 500 feet for non-precision instrument runways having visibility minimums greater than three-fourths statue mile.

(iii) 1,000 feet for a non-precision instru- ment runway having a non-precision instru- ment approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths of a statute mile, and for precision instrument runways.

(iv) The width of the primary surface of a runway will be that width prescribed in this section for the most precise approach exist- ing or planned for either end of that runway.

(d) Approach surface. A surface longitu- dinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and up- ward from each end of the primary surface. An approach surface is applied to each end of each runway based upon the type of ap- proach available or planned for that runway end.

(1) The inner edge of the approach surface is the same width as the primary surface and it expands uniformly to a width of:

(i) 1,250 feet for that end of a utility run- way with only visual approaches;

(ii) 1,500 feet for that end of a runway other than a utility runway with only visual ap- proaches;

(iii) 2,000 feet for that end of a utility run- way with a non-precision instrument ap- proach;

(iv) 3,500 feet for that end of a non-preci- sion instrument runway other than utility, having visibility minimums greater that three-fourths of a statute mile;

(v) 4,000 feet for that end of a non-precision instrument runway, other than utility, hav- ing a non-precision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three- fourths statute mile; and

(vi) 16,000 feet for precision instrument runways.

(2) The approach surface extends for a hori- zontal distance of:

(i) 5,000 feet at a slope of 20 to 1 for all util- ity and visual runways;

(ii) 10,000 feet at a slope of 34 to 1 for all non-precision instrument run runways other than utility; and

(iii) 10,000 feet at a slope of 50 to 1 with an additional 40,000 feet at a slope of 40 to 1 for all precision instrument runways.

(3) The outer width of an approach surface
to an end of a runway will be that width pre-
scribed in this subsection for the most pre-
cise approach existing or planned for that
runway end.

(e) *Transitional surface.* These surfaces ex-
tend outward and upward at right angles to
the runway centerline and the runway cen-
terline extended at a slope of 7 to 1 from the
sides of the primary surface and from the
sides of the approach surfaces. Transitional
surfaces for those portions of the precision
approach surface which project through and
beyond the limits of the conical surface, ex-
tend a distance of 5,000 feet measured hori-
zontally from the edge of the approach sur-
face and at right angles to the runway cen-
terline.

Â§77.21 Department of Defense (DOD) air-
port imaginary surfaces.

(a) *Related to airport reference points.* These
surfaces apply to all military airports. For
the purposes of this section, a military air-
port is any airport operated by the DOD.

(1) *Inner horizontal surface.* A plane that is
oval in shape at a height of 150 feet above the
established airfield elevation. The plane is
constructed by scribing an arc with a radius
of 7,500 feet about the centerline at the end
of each runway and interconnecting these
arcs with tangents.

(2) *Conical surface.* A surface extending
from the periphery of the inner horizontal
surface outward and upward at a slope of 20
to 1 for a horizontal distance of 7,000 feet to
a height of 500 feet above the established air-
field elevation.

(3) *Outer horizontal surface.* A plane, located
500 feet above the established airfield ele-
vation, extending outward from the outer pe-
riphery of the conical surface for a hori-
zontal distance of 30.000 feet.

(b) *Related to runways.* These surfaces apply
to all military airports.

(1) *Primary surface.* A surface located on
the ground or water longitudinally centered
on each runway with the same length as the
runway. The width of the primary surface for
runways is 2,000 feet. However, at established
bases where substantial construction has
taken place in accordance with a previous
lateral clearance criteria, the 2,000-foot
width may be reduced to the former criteria.

(2) *Clear zone surface.* A surface located on
the ground or water at each end of the pri-
mary surface, with a length of 1,000 feet and
the same width as the primary surface.

(3) *Approach clearance surface.* An inclined
plane, symmetrical about the runway center-
line extended, beginning 200 feet beyond each
end of the primary surface at the centerline
elevation of the runway end and extending
for 50,000 feet. The slope of the approach
clearance surface is 50 to 1 along the runway
centerline extended until it reaches an ele-
vation of 500 feet above the established air-

Pt. 77, Nt.

port elevation. It then continues hori-
zontally at this elevation to a point 50,000
feet from the point of beginning. The width
of this surface at the runway end is the same
as the primary surface, it flares uniformly,
and the width at 50,000 is 16,000 feet.

(4) *Transitional surfaces.* These surfaces
connect the primary surfaces, the first 200
feet of the clear zone surfaces, and the ap-
proach clearance surfaces to the inner hori-
zontal surface, conical surface, outer hori-
zontal surface or other transitional surfaces.
The slope of the transitional surface is 7 to
1 outward and upward at right angles to the
runway centerline.

Â§77.23 Heliport imaginary surfaces.

(a) *Primary surface.* The area of the primary
surface coincides in size and shape with the
designated take-off and landing area. This
surface is a horizontal plane at the elevation
of the established heliport elevation.

(b) *Approach surface.* The approach surface
begins at each end of the heliport primary
surface with the same width as the primary
surface, and extends outward and upward for
a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet where its
width is 500 feet. The slope of the approach
surface is 8 to 1 for civil heliports and 10 to
1 for military heliports.

(c) *Transitional surfaces.* These surfaces ex-
tend outward and upward from the lateral
boundaries of the primary surface and from
the approach surfaces at a slope of 2 to 1 for
a distance of 250 feet measured horizontally
from the centerline of the primary and ap-
proach surfaces.

Subpart DâAeronautical Studies and
Determinations

Â§77.25 Applicability.

(a) This subpart applies to any aero-
nautical study of a proposed construction or
alteration for which notice to the FAA is re-
quired under Â§ 77.9.

(b) The purpose of an aeronautical study is
to determine whether the aeronautical ef-
fects of the specific proposal and, where ap-
propriate, the cumulative impact resulting
from the proposed construction or alteration
when combined with the effects of other ex-
isting or proposed structures, would con-
stitute a hazard to air navigation.

(c) The obstruction standards in subpart C
of this part are supplemented by other
manuals and directives used in determining
the effect on the navigable airspace of a pro-
posed construction or alteration. When the
FAA needs additional information, it may
circulate a study to interested parties for
comment.

575

Pt. 77, Nt.

(a) Requested by the sponsor of any pro-
posed construction or alteration for which a
notice is submitted; or

(b) The FAA determines a study is nec-
essary.

Â§77.29 Evaluating aeronautical effect.

(a) The FAA conducts an aeronautical
study to determine the impact of a proposed
structure, an existing structure that has not
yet been studied by the FAA, or an alter-
ation of an existing structure on aero-
nautical operations, procedures, and the
safety of flight. These studies include evalu-
ating:

(1) The impact on arrival, departure, and
en route procedures for aircraft operating
under visual flight rules;

(2) The impact on arrival, departure, and
en route procedures for aircraft operating
under instrument flight rules;

(3) The impact on existing and planned
public use airports;

(4) Airport traffic capacity of existing pub-
lic use airports and public use airport devel-
opment plans received before the issuance of
the final determination;

(5) Minimum obstacle clearance altitudes,
minimum instrument flight rules altitudes,
approved or planned instrument approach
procedures, and departure procedures;

(6) The potential effect on ATC radar, di-
rection finders, ATC tower line-of-sight visi-
bility, and physical or electromagnetic ef-
fects on air navigation, communication fa-
cilities, and other surveillance systems;

(7) The aeronautical effects resulting from
the cumulative impact of a proposed con-
struction or alteration of a structure when
combined with the effects of other existing
or proposed structures.

(b) If you withdraw the proposed construc-
tion or alteration or revise it so that it is no
longer identified as an obstruction, or if no
further aeronautical study is necessary, the
FAA may terminate the study.

Â§77.31 Determinations.

(a) The FAA will issue a determination
stating whether the proposed construction or
alteration would be a hazard to air naviga-
tion, and will advise all known interested
persons.

(b) The FAA will make determinations
based on the aeronautical study findings and
will identify the following:

(1) The effects on VFR/IFR aeronautical
departure/arrival operations, air traffic pro-
cedures, minimum flight altitudes, and ex-
isting, planned, or proposed airports listed in
Â§77.15(e) of which the FAA has received ac-
tual notice prior to issuance of a final deter-
mination.

(2) The extent of the physical and/or elec-
tromagnetic effect on the operation of exist-
ing or proposed air navigation facilities,

14 CFR Ch. I (1-1-11 Edition)

communication aids, or surveillance sys-
tems.

(c) The FAA will issue a Determination of
Hazard to Air Navigation when the aero-
nautical study concludes that the proposed
construction or alteration will exceed an ob-
struction standard and would have a sub-
stantial aeronautical impact.

(d) A Determination of No Hazard to Air
Navigation will be issued when the aero-
nautical study concludes that the proposed
construction or alteration will exceed an ob-
struction standard but would not have a sub-
stantial aeronautical impact to air naviga-
tion. A Determination of No Hazard to Air
Navigation may include the following:

(1) Conditional provisions of a determina-
tion.

(2) Limitations necessary to minimize po-
tential problems, such as the use of tem-
porary construction equipment.

(3) Supplemental notice requirements,
when required.

(4) Marking and lighting recommenda-
tions, as appropriate.

(e) The FAA will issue a Determination of
No Hazard to Air Navigation when a pro-
posed structure does not exceed any of the
obstruction standards and would not be a
hazard to air navigation.

Â§77.33 Effective period of determinations.

(a) A determination issued under this sub-
part is effective 40 days after the date of
issuance, unless a petition for discretionary
review is received by the FAA within 30 days
after issuance. The determination will not
become final pending disposition of a peti-
tion for discretionary review.

(b) Unless extended, revised, or terminated,
each Determination of No Hazard to Air
Navigation issued under this subpart expires
18 months after the effective date of the de-
termination, or on the date the proposed
construction or alteration is abandoned,
whichever is earlier.

(c) A Determination of Hazard to Air Navi-
gation has no expiration date.

Â§77.35 Extensions, terminations, revisions
and corrections.

(a) You may petition the FAA official that
issued the Determination of No Hazard to
Air Navigation to revise or reconsider the
determination based on new facts or to ex-
tend the effective period of the determina-
tion, provided that:

(1) Actual structural work of the proposed
construction or alteration, such as the lay-
ing of a foundation, but not including exca-
vation, has not been started; and

(2) The petition is submitted at least 15
days before the expiration date of the Deter-
mination of No Hazard to Air Navigation.

(b) A Determination of No Hazard to Air
Navigation issued for those construction or
alteration proposals not requiring an FCC

construction permit may be extended by the FAA one time for a period not to exceed 18 months.

(c) A Determination of No Hazard to Air Navigation issued for a proposal requiring an FCC construction permit may be granted extensions for up to 18 months, provided that:

(1) You submit evidence that an applica- tion for a construction permit/license was filed with the FCC for the associated site within 6 months of issuance of the deter- mination; and

(2) You submit evidence that additional time is warranted because of FCC require- ments; and

(3) Where the FCC issues a construction permit, a final Determination of No Hazard to Air Navigation is effective until the date prescribed by the FCC for completion of the construction. If an extension of the original FCC completion date is needed, an extension of the FAA determination must be requested from the Obstruction Evaluation Service (OES).

(4) If the Commission refuses to issue a construction permit, the final determination expires on the date of its refusal.

Subpart EâPetitions for Discretionary Review

Â§77.37 General.

(a) If you are the sponsor, provided a sub- stantive aeronautical comment on a proposal in an aeronautical study, or have a sub- stantive aeronautical comment on the pro- posal but were not given an opportunity to state it, you may petition the FAA for a dis- cretionary review of a determination, revi- sion, or extension of a determination issued by the FAA.

(b) You may not file a petition for discre- tionary review for a Determination of No Hazard that is issued for a temporary struc- ture, marking and lighting recommendation, or when a proposed structure or alteration

Pt. 77, Nt.

does not exceed obstruction standards con- tained in subpart C of this part.
