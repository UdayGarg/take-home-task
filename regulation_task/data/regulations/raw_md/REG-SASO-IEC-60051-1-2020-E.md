uncertainty of the result of a direct measurement of a measurand having negligible intrinsic
uncertainty

coverage factor 2.

Note 2 to entry: In single-reading direct measurements of measurands having intrinsic uncertainty small with respect
to the instrumental uncertainty, the uncertainty of the measurement coincides, by definition, with the instrumental
uncertainty. Otherwise the instrumental uncertainty is to be treated as a component of category B in evaluating the
uncertainty of the measurement on the basis of the model connecting the several direct measurements involved.

Note 3 to entry: The instrumental uncertainty automatically includes, by definition, the effects due to the
quantization of the reading-values (minimum evaluable fraction of the scale interval in analogic outputs, unit of the
last stable digit in digital outputs).

Note 4 to entry: For material measures the instrumental uncertainty is the uncertainty that should be associated to
the value of the quantity reproduced by the material measure in order to ensure the compatibility of the results of its
measurements.

Note 5 to entry: When possible and convenient the uncertainty may be expressed in the relative form (see 3.3.3)
or in the fiducial form (see 3.3.4). The relative uncertainty is the ratio U/V of the absolute uncertainty U to the measure
value V, and the fiducial uncertainty is the ratio U/V of the absolute uncertainty U to a conventionally chosen value
V

3.7.4
operating instrumental uncertainty
instrumental uncertainty under the rated operating condition

Note 1 to entry: The operating instrumental uncertainty, like the intrinsic one, is not evaluated by the user of the
instrument, but is stated by its manufacturer or calibrator. The statement may be expressed by means of an algebraic
relation involving the intrinsic instrumental uncertainty and the values of one or several influence quantities, but such
a relation is just a convenient means of expressing a set of operating instrumental uncertainties under different
operating conditions, not a functional relation to be used for evaluating the propagation of uncertainty inside the
instrument.

[SOURCE: IEC 60359:2001, 3.2.11]

3.7.5
limit of uncertainty
limiting value of the instrumental uncertainty for equipment operating under specified conditions

Note 1 to entry: A limit of uncertainty may be assigned by the manufacturer of the instrument, who states that under
the specified conditions the instrumental uncertainty is never higher than this limit, or may be defined by standards,
that prescribe that under specified conditions the instrumental uncertainty should not be larger than this limit for the
instrument to belong to a given accuracy class.

Note 2 to entry: A limit of uncertainty may be expressed in absolute terms or in the relative or fiducial forms.

[SOURCE: IEC 60359:2001, 3.3.6]

3.7.6
variation (due to an influence quantity)
difference between the indicated values for the same value of the measurand of an indicating
instrument, or the values of a material measure, when an influence quantity assumes,
successively, two different values

Note 1 to entry: The uncertainty associated with the different measure values of the influence quantity for which
the variation is evaluated should not be wider than the width of the reference range for the same influence quantity.
The other performance characteristics and the other influence quantities should stay within the ranges specified for
the reference conditions.

Note 2 to entry: The variation is a meaningful parameter when it is greater than the intrinsic instrumental uncertainty.

6.2.5 Markings for accessories and special markings for instruments, together with their
locations, are given in the relevant parts.

6.2.6 By agreement between the manufacturer and the user, any or all of the information
may be omitted.

6.3 Markings relating to the reference values and nominal ranges of use of influence
quantities

6.3.1 Where a reference value or a reference range is different from that given in Table 2 it
shall be marked and shall be distinguished by being underlined. It is identified by the symbol of
the unit in which it is measured.

6.3.2 When a nominal range of use is different from that given in Table 3 it shall be marked.

The marking is carried out in conjunction with marking the reference value or reference range.
This then requires the marking of the reference value or reference range even if it would not
otherwise be necessary.

6.3.3 The marking is done by writing the limits of the nominal range of use and the reference
value (or range) in ascending order, each number separated from its neighbour by three dots.

EXAMPLE 1 35 Hz ... 50 Hz ... 60 Hz implies a reference frequency of 50 Hz and a nominal range of use for frequency
from 35 Hz to 60 Hz.

EXAMPLE 2 35 Hz ... 45 Hz ... 55 Hz ... 60 Hz implies a reference frequency range from 45 Hz to 55 Hz and a
nominal range of use for frequency from 35 Hz to 60 Hz.

6.3.4 When any limit of the nominal range of use is the same as the reference value or the
adjacent limit of the reference range, the number indicating the reference value or the limit of
the reference range shall be repeated for the limit of the nominal range of use.

EXAMPLE 1 23 Â°C ... 23 Â°C ... 37 Â°C implies a reference temperature of 23 Â°C and a nominal range of use for
temperature from 23 Â°C to 37 Â°C.

EXAMPLE 2 20 Â°C ... 20 Â°C ... 25 Â°C ... 35 Â°C implies a reference temperature range from 20 Â°C to 25 Â°C and a
nominal range of use for temperature from 20 Â°C to 35 Â°C.

6.4 The symbols for marking instruments and accessories

The symbols for units of measurement and their prefixes are given in Table 5.

The symbol of a prefix (if needed) immediately precedes, without a space, the symbol of a unit.
If there is a number, it is followed by a space before the prefix (if any) and the unit.

EXAMPLE 23 Â°C, 120 mV.

8.5 Nonconformity classification

Nonconformity can be classified such as: class A, class B and class C. The weight of class A
is 1, the weight of class B is 0,6, the weight of class C is 0,2. Nonconformity classification of
tests is given in Annex A of IEC 60051-2 to 8.

8.6 Judgement of test results

During the test, if weight of nonconformity class A or other class translating to A of any specimen
is accumulatively no less than 1, the specimen is a nonconforming item. Unless otherwise stated,
the nonconformity which repeats on the same test of the same specimen is considered as one.

Annex A
(normative)

Limits of intrinsic uncertainty and variations

A.1 When an instrument or an accessory is operated under reference conditions, it is
permitted to have an uncertainty (the intrinsic uncertainty) no greater than that implied by its
class index, for example, for a class 0,5 instrument, the intrinsic uncertainties are not permitted
to exceed 0,5 % of the fiducial value.

A.2 However, when an instrument or an accessory is operated outside its reference conditions
for a particular influence quantity (but under reference conditions for all the other influence
quantities), it is permitted to have a change in its uncertainty, called a variation, when that
influence quantity is changed up to the limit of its nominal range of use. The value of the
permissible variation is expressed as a percentage (usually 100 %) of the permissible intrinsic
uncertainty.

A.3 The same value of variation is permitted over the whole of the nominal range of use up to
both of its limits, but the sign need not be the same.

A.4 For example, an instrument having a class index of 0,5 and a reference temperature of
40 Â°C, marked as 40 Â°C in accordance with 6.3.1, is permitted to have an intrinsic uncertainty
of Â±100 % of the class index, at the reference temperature and over the testing tolerance of
Â±2 Â°C (see Table 2) around 40 Â°C.

A.5 In addition, over the nominal range of use for temperature of 30 Â°C to 50 Â°C (reference
temperature is 40 Â°C), this instrument is permitted to have a variation of Â±100 % of the class
index around the value of the uncertainty which it had at the reference temperature (40 Â°C). It
is thus possible for the instrument to have a smaller uncertainty at some temperature within the
nominal range of use than it had at the reference temperature.

> [Figure]
> This figure shows a graph of Uncertainty vs Temperature. The y-axis is labeled as 'Uncertainty' and shows values +2c, +c, 0, -c, -2c from top to bottom. The x-axis is labeled 'Temperature Â°C' and shows values 30, 38, 40, 42, 50 from left to right. The uncertainty/temperature curve of the instrument and its relation to the class index c are also shown.

NOTE 1 Reference value: 40 Â°C.

NOTE 2 Nominal range of use (Table 3): 30 Â°C to 50 Â°C.

A.6 Figure A.1 shows how the uncertainty of this instrument is permitted to alter with
temperature, the class index being shown as c.

SAUDI STANDADR
SASO IEC 60051-1: 2020

A.7 If the uncertainty at the reference temperature (the intrinsic uncertainty) had been at its
maximum permitted value of +c, the total permitted uncertainty over the temperature ranges
30 Â°C to 38 Â°C and 42 Â°C to 50 Â°C would have been between zero and +2c. Similarly, if the
intrinsic uncertainty had been -c, the total permitted uncertainty would have been from zero to
-2c.

A.8 When the reference condition of a particular influence quantity is a reference range, over
the parts of the nominal range of use which are outside the reference range, the permissible
variation is centred on the value of the uncertainty at the adjacent limit of the reference range.

A.9 For temperature influence quantity of group A and group B, the variation due to influence
quantities changes from the reference temperature to the upper and lower of nominal
temperature range. For temperature influence quantity of group C, the variation is a temperature
coefficient. The permissible variation of an instrument or an accessory caused by the
temperature influence quantity changed per 10K from the reference temperature (the reference
temperature range) is the value of Â±50 % of the class index, in nominal temperature range.

A.10 Figure A.2 is an example of an instrument having a class index of 0,5 and marked â
30 Â°C ... +10 Â°C ... +30 Â°C .. +50 Â°C in accordance with 6.3.4 (reference range for temperature
+10 Â°C to +30 Â°C; nominal range of use for temperature -30 Â°C to +50 Â°C) is permitted to have
an intrinsic uncertainty of Â±100 % of the class index over the temperature range +10 Â°C to
+30 Â°C.

> [Figure]
> Diagram showing the uncertainty/temperature curve of the instrument. The vertical axis represents uncertainty, labeled with values -2c, -c, 0, +c, and +2c. The horizontal axis indicates temperature in degrees Celsius, marked with -30, +10, +30, and +50. A curve illustrates the uncertainty/temperature relationship, intersecting the 0 uncertainty line between -30 and +10 degrees, and again between +30 and +50 degrees. Horizontal dashed lines extend from the uncertainty values on the y-axis. The class index 'c' is marked on the right side of the diagram along two vertical lines, and "c = class index" is given below.

NOTE 1 Reference range: +10 Â°C to +30 Â°C (different from Table 2).

NOTE 2 Nominal range of use: -30 Â°C to +50 Â°C (different from Table 3).

**Figure A.2 â Effect of temperature**

A.11 In addition, over the nominal range of use of -30 Â°C to +10 Â°C, a variation is permitted
of Â±100 % of the class index centred on the uncertainty which the instrument had at +10 Â°C.
Similarly, a variation of Â±100 % of the class index, centred on the uncertainty which the
instrument had at +30 Â°C is permitted over the nominal range use from +30 Â°C to +50 Â°C.

A.12 If, as is likely in practice, more than one influence quantity is simultaneously outside its
reference condition, the resultant uncertainty is unlikely to exceed the sum of the separate
variations and may be smaller than any of them, as the resulting uncertainties may to some
extent cancel each other.

A.13 Information about the simultaneous effect of several influence quantities can usually only
be determined by carrying out tests for particular combinations of values of influence quantities.
The manufacturer may sometimes be able to provide this information.

A.14 Manufacturers usually may not be able to provide the information about the simultaneous
effect of several or all of influence quantities. Users can evaluate the maximum permitted

The x-axis represents relative humidity in percentage, ranging from 0 to 100. Three curves on the graph represent different conditions: "Limits for each of 30 days spread in a natural manner over one year" (dashed line), "Limits occasionally reached on other days" (dotted line), and "Annual mean" (solid line). An area in the upper right corner of the graph is labeled "Climatic conditions that do not occur in practice," while a smaller area near the bottom right corner is labeled "Climatic conditions that do occur in practice."

Estimation of uncertainties

C.1 Uncertainties in this standard

Uncertainties described in this part of IEC 60051 are shown in Figure C.1.

> [Figure] Diagram of uncertainties shown as concentric circles. The innermost circle represents uncertainty under reference conditions. The next larger circle shows variations due to influence quantities. The outermost circle is labeled uncertainty and variations due to external sensors accuracy and to impedance of wires. Arrows point from these circles to blocks on the right that are, from top to bottom: Overall system uncertainty, Operating uncertainty and Measurement uncertainty, and Intrinsic uncertainty.

C.2 Operating uncertainty

C.2.1 General

Operating uncertainty shall include intrinsic uncertainty (under reference conditions) and the variations due to influence quantities. The users have two ways to estimate the maximum operating uncertainty of instrument in use. One way is to estimate according to type test data provided by the manufacturer, the other way is to estimate according to limit of intrinsic uncertainty and limit of variations due to every influence specified by this standard relating to their class index.

C.2.2 Estimating absolute operating uncertainty according to type test results

Operating uncertainty shall include intrinsic uncertainty (under reference conditions) and the variations due to influence quantities.

When manufacturers provide type test data, absolute operating uncertainty can be estimated using Formula C.1. Intrinsic uncertainty has dependency with each influence quantity, the variations obtained from type test can be treated as rectangular distribution, and the influence quantities are mutually independent. The operating uncertainty is expanded uncertainty which

has a coverage factor of 2 (corresponding to a coverage probability of approximately 95 %), then:

$$U_{op} = U_{int} + 2\sqrt{\frac{V_1^2}{\sqrt{3}^2} + \frac{V_2^2}{\sqrt{3}^2} + ......+ \frac{V_n^2}{\sqrt{3}^2}}$$

$$U_{op} = U_{int} + 1,15\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n V_i^2}$$

(C.1)

Where:
$U_{op}$ absolute operating uncertainty;
$U_{int}$ absolute intrinsic uncertainty;
$V_i$ variations due to every influence (in rated operating range), which are determined in the test;
$i$ the number of variations;
$n$ the quantities of variations.

C.2.3 Estimating absolute operating uncertainty according to limit of intrinsic uncertainty and limit of variations due to every influence specified by this standard

Without a manufacturer's type test data, absolute operating uncertainty can be estimated according to the limit of intrinsic uncertainty and the limit of variations due to every influence specified by this part of IEC 60051 relating to the class index, using Formula C.2.

In addition, intrinsic uncertainty is related to influence quantities, and influence quantities are mutually independent. The limits of variations specified by this part of IEC 60051 can be treated as Gaussian distribution. Operating uncertainty is expanded uncertainty which has a coverage factor of 2 (corresponding to a coverage probability of approximately 95 %). The limits of variations specified by this standard have a coverage factor of 2, so half of the variation limit is considered as the standard uncertainty. Then:

$$U_{op} = U_{int} + 2\sqrt{\frac{V_1^2}{2^2} + \frac{V_2^2}{2^2} + ......+ \frac{V_n^2}{2^2}}$$

$$U_{op} = U_{int} + \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n V_i^2}$$

(C.2)

Where:
$U_{op}$ is the absolute operating uncertainty obtained from this standard;
$U_{int}$ is the absolute intrinsic uncertainty specified by this standard;
$V_i$ is the variations due to every influence (in rated operating range), which are specified in Table 3 and related parts of this standard;
$i$ is the number of variations;
$n$ is the quantities of variations.

**C.3 Overall system uncertainty**

The overall system uncertainty of an instrument with external accessory(ies) such as shunt,
resistor and impedance shall include the operating uncertainty of the instrument, the uncertainty
of the impedance of wires and the operating uncertainty of accessory(ies)

Formula (C.3) is a simplified approach, and applies only to voltage, current, active power,
reactive power, power factor and phase measurements:

$$U_s = 1,15 \sqrt{U_{op}^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{N}(U_a + U_w)^2}$$

(C.3)

Where:

$U_s$ overall system uncertainty;

$U_{op}$ absolute operating uncertainty of an instrument;

$U_a$ absolute operating uncertainty of interchangeable accessory;

$U_w$ absolute uncertainty of impedance of wires;

$N$ the quantities of accessories;

$i$ the number of transducer or wires.

**C.4 Fiducial operating uncertainty**

According to 3.7.1, Note 5, the fiducial uncertainty is the ratio $U/V_f$ of the absolute uncertainty
$U$ to a conventionally chosen value $V_f$. So, the fiducial operating uncertainty expressed in
percentage shall be determined using Formula C.4:

$$U_F = \frac{U_{abs}}{F}100\%$$

(C.4)

Where:

$U_F$ fiducial operating uncertainty;

$U_{abs}$ absolute operating uncertainty;

$F$ fiducial value.
