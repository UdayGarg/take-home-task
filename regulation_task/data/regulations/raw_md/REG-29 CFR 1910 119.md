Regional Administrator to submit non-Field Operations Manual/Technical
Manual Federal Program Changes.

a.
If the State intends to follow the revised inspection procedures described
in this instruction, the State must submit either a revised version of this
instruction, adapted as appropriate to reference State law, regulations and
administrative structure, or a cover sheet describing how references in this
instruction correspond to the State's structure. The State's acknowledgment
letter may fulfill the plan supplement requirement if the appropriate
documentation is provided.

b.
If the State adopts an alternative to Federal enforcement inspection
procedures, the State's plan supplement must identify and provide a
rationale for all substantial differences from Federal procedures in order
for OSHA to judge whether a different State procedure is as effective as
the comparable procedure.

7. After Regional review of the State plan supplement and resolution of any
comments thereon, forward the State submission to the National Office in
accordance with established procedures. The Regional Administrator shall
provide a judgment on the relative effectiveness of each substantial difference in
the State plan change and an overall assessment thereon with a recommendation
for approval or disapproval by the Assistant Secretary.

8. Review policies, instructions, and guidelines issued by the States to determine
that this change has been communicated to State program personnel.

G. **Background.** On February 24, 1992, OSHA promulgated the Final Rule for Process
Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. This standard originally became
effective on May 26, 1992. An administrative stay delayed the effective date of
paragraphs (f), (h), (j), and (1) until August 26, 1992. That stay has expired and the stayed
provisions are now fully effective.

1. In recent years, a number of catastrophic accidents in the chemical industry have
drawn attention to the safety of processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.
OSHA has determined that employees have

NOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 7

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Page 4]

been and continue to be exposed in their workplaces to the hazards of releases of
highly hazardous chemicals which may be toxic, reactive, flammable, or
explosive.

2.  The requirements of the PSM standard are intended to eliminate or mitigate the
consequences of such releases. The standard emphasizes the application of
management controls when addressing the risks associated with handling or
working near hazardous chemicals.

3.  In addition, the PSM standard has been developed in fulfillment of OSHA's
obligation under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990, section
304(a). The final rule is consistent with the mandate of the CAAA.

4.  It is anticipated that joint inspection activities related to the PSM standard will
arise between OSHA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Chemical
Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, which was mandated by the CAAA.

H. Enforcement Activity Related to the PSM Standard--Types of Inspections. 29 CFR
1910.119 has broad applicability to potentially hazardous processes that may exist in a
wide variety of industries. Accordingly, enforcement activities related to the PSM
standard--either to determine if an employer is covered by the standard or to assess the
employer's compliance with it--may take place in any of the inspection types described
below. The following guidelines shall apply to PSM-related compliance activity:

1.  Program-Quality-Verification (PQV) Inspections. The primary enforcement
model for the PSM standard shall be the PQV inspection, as described at K. and
L. of this instruction. Programmed PQV inspections shall be scheduled as
described at J. of this instruction.

2.  Other Programmed Inspections: Screening for PSM Coverage. In all
programmed safety and health inspections in general industry, a determination
shall be made as to whether the establishment is covered by the PSM standard.

a.  This determination shall follow the criteria presented at 29 CFR
1910.119(a), including appropriate reference to Appendix A of 1910.119.
The determination may be made in conjunction with

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 8

NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Replacement page 5]

an assessment of the employer's Hazard Communication program.

b. If the establishment is found to be covered by the standard:

(1) It shall be further determined if the establishment is included in the
universe of affected establishments from which PQV inspections may
be scheduled. (See J. of this instruction.)

(2) The employer shall be provided:

(a) Copies of the OSHA publications "Process Safety Management," OSHA Publication 3132, which also contains the full text of 1910.119; and "Process Safety Management -- Guidelines for Compliance;" and

(b) A letter notifying the employer that the subject establishment is covered by the PSM standard and may be inspected under the standard. The letter shall also emphasize the employer's obligation to comply with the standard. An example of such a letter is provided as Appendix F of this instruction.

c. The Area Director shall ensure proper coding of the OSHA-1 (as described at Q. and Appendix H of this instruction) to identify the establishment as either known to be covered by the PSM standard or known not to be covered by the standard.

3. Unprogrammed PSM-related Inspections. In all unprogrammed inspection activity relating to the PSM standard, a determination shall be made as to whether the establishment is covered by 29 CFR 1910.119.

a. If a formal complaint or referral relating to the PSM standard is received regarding any workplace classified in one of the SIC codes listed at Appendix C of this instruction, the complaint or referral item(s) shall be investigated and:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 9

NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Replacement page 6]

(1) All programs required by the PSM standard shall be screened for
obvious violations; and

(2) A CSHO referral for a PQV inspection shall be considered if major
deficiencies are indicated. This determination shall be documented in
the case file.

b. Investigations of formal, PSM-related complaints and referrals in
establishments in all other SIC codes shall normally be limited to the
complaint item(s) only, unless violations related to the complaint or
referral items are found.

4. Responses to Accidents and Catastrophes. Responses to accidents and
catastrophes involving PSM shall follow the guidelines contained in Chapter VIII
of the FOM and -- where appropriate -- in OSHA Instruction CPL 2.94, "OSHA
Response to Significant Events of Potentially Catastrophic Consequence," in
addition to the guidelines of this instruction. If the workplace is classified in one
of the SIC codes listed at Appendix C of this instruction, a PQV inspection shall
be considered; the reasons for the determination shall be documented in the case
file.

5. All Other Inspections. Normally, there shall be no PSM-related activity on any
inspection other than those described at H.1. through H.4., above.

I. Inspection Resources. Appropriate levels of staff training and preparation are essential
for compliance activities relating to the PSM standard. In particular, it is anticipated that
PQV inspections will be highly resource- intensive; they will therefore require careful
planning and coordination. The recommendations included as Appendix G of this
instruction may be used as a guide for such planning.

1. PQV Team Leaders ("Level One"). Only trained compliance safety and health
officers (CSHOs) with experience in the chemical industry (and/or the explosives
industry, as appropriate) shall be assigned to lead a PQV inspection under this
standard.

a. As a minimum, this training must include the OSHA Training Institute's
Course 330, "Safety and Health in the Chemical Processing Industries,"
and Course 340, "Hazard Analysis in the Chemical

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 10

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *

[Replacement page 7]

Processing Industries." A section of Course 340 will deal with explosives manufacture.

NOTE: (1) Due to a significant change in course content, completion of Course 330 prior to Fiscal Year 1991 does not meet this requirement for PQV team leaders.

(2) All CSHOs who will serve as PQV team leaders should have additional advanced training such as that offered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the U.S. Bureau of Mines.

b. Team leaders must have prior experience in the chemical industry. This experience should include experience obtained from accident/explosion investigations in chemical or petrochemical plants, through previous chemical inspections involving process safety management evaluation, or through previous chemical industry employment.

c. For PQV inspections of explosives manufacturers, team leaders shall have had experience in the explosives industry.

2. PQV Team Members ("Level Two"). CSHOs may be assigned as PQV team members, or to conduct unprogrammed inspections in workplaces in the targeted SIC codes listed in Appendix C of this instruction, if they have 2 years of OSHA inspection experience or the equivalent and have completed Course 330, "Safety and Health in the Chemical Processing Industries" (including offerings of this course prior to Fiscal Year 1991) and Course 340, "Hazard Analysis in the Chemical Processing Industries."

3. CSHOS With Less Training. Complaint and other unprogrammed inspections pertaining to some sections of the standard may be conducted by CSHOs who do not have the training and experience described at I.1. or I.2., above, but who are experienced in evaluating other programmatic standards such as hazard communication and lockout/tagout and in evaluating respirator programs.

a. The following sections of 29 CFR 1910.119 may be appropriately evaluated by such CSHOs:

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 11

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Replacement page 8]

*   (c) Employee participation.
*   (g) Training.
*   (h) Contractors.
*   (k) Hot work permits.
*   (m) Incident investigation.
*   (n) Emergency planning and response.

b. Such CSHOs shall make full utilization of Technical Support resources at
the Regional Office and National Office levels in arriving at decisions
regarding compliance or noncompliance.

c. Nevertheless, to the extent possible, Area Directors shall attempt to utilize
CSHOs with experience and training in the chemical industry to perform
such unprogrammed inspections.

4. State Plan States. Each State shall have one or more CSHOs trained to meet the
requirements for PQV team leaders and an appropriate number of qualified team
members. OSHA will provide technical assistance, as needed, through the
Regional Office, Health Response Team, and the Office of Construction and
Engineering.

J. PQV Inspection Scheduling. Due to the resource-intensive nature of inspections for
compliance with the PSM standard, the Agency will be able to perform only a limited
number of PQV inspections (as described at K. and L. of this instruction) each year. A
special targeting and scheduling system is therefore necessary to maximize the effective
use of inspection resources.

1. Targeting. OSHA wishes to make the most effective use of its limited resources,
and therefore will use the factors listed below in determining the SIC codes to be
inspected. OSHA will select the SICs that have experienced the greatest number
of accidents/incidents as determined from these three sources:

a. Published insurance industry reports of major accidents/incidents.

NOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 12

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Replacement page 9]

b. IMIS data, including the OSHA-170 Investigation Summary File.

c. EPA Accident Release Information Program (ARIP) data.

2. **Current Targeted SICs.** A list of targeted SIC codes based on current data, as described at J.1., is included as Appendix C of this instruction. This Appendix may be updated periodically.

3. **Scheduling.** PQV inspections shall be scheduled as follows:

a. Using the list of SICs determined as described at J.1. above, the Office of Statistics shall annually create an initial list including all known establishments within each of the identified SICs for each Region. This list shall be organized by establishment, by establishment size, by corporate identity (as determined through a commercially available source), and by State.

b. The Directorate of Compliance Programs shall forward the initial lists to the appropriate Regions. A Region may add to its initial list establishments that are known to be in the identified SICs and to have more than 10 employees.

c. Within 30 days of receipt of the initial list, each Region shall select five candidates for a PQV inspection and shall forward the resulting list, together with documentation supporting the selections, to the Directorate of Compliance Programs. The Regions shall base their selection on such factors as:

(1) Number of employees at the facility.
(2) Age of the facility.

(3) Known toxicity of chemicals used in the facility's processes.

(4) Frequency of media reports of releases or other incidents at the facility.

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 13

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Replacement page 10]

(5) Local EPA information.

(6) Past OSHA history of the facility, including complaints received
and/or follow-up inspections due.

(7) Information from local/municipal fire departments.

NOTE: The Regions need not make a determination on each of these
factors for each establishment on their initial list; however, their
selections for candidates shall be thoroughly documented.

d. Beginning with Fiscal Year 1994, Regional Administrators shall provide
to each State designee a copy of the establishment list within their State.
Each State shall nominate one establishment for a PQV inspection or
provide an explanation of why a PQV inspection should not be scheduled
in their State. Regional Administrators shall include these candidates with
their regional submission (i.e., in addition to the five candidates submitted
by each Region) to the Directorate of Compliance Programs, together with
their assessment and recommendation as to whether the State's candidate
should be included in the national selection and as to the State's degree of
readiness to conduct the inspection independently.

e. Within 60 days of the receipt of the candidate lists from the Regions, the
Directorate of Compliance Programs shall notify each Region of the final
list of establishments from which PQV inspections are to be scheduled.

(1) The selections for the Regional lists shall be made by the Directorate
of Compliance Programs in coordination with the Office of Field
Programs. The selections shall be based on:

(a) Emphasis on a corporate approach, to give inspection priority to the
maximum number of different corporations, rather

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 14

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Replacement page 11]

than targeting multiple inspections in the same corporation; and

(b) Regional resources and inspection goals; and

(c) Overall Agency resources.

(2) Inspection goals (actual numbers) are to be set in the annual Field
Operations Program Plan between Regions and the Office of Field
Programs.

(3) The number of establishments selected may vary from Region to
Region, because OSHA plans to focus more PQV inspections in
Regions with higher concentrations of high-hazard industries affected
by the standard.

(4) The selections from the States' list shall be coordinated with the Office
of State Programs. Regional Administrators shall include full
discussion and coordination with the affected States.

4. **Deletion Criteria.** An establishment shall be deleted from the list if it:

a. Has received a substantially complete systems safety inspection or PQV
 inspection within the current or the preceding 5 calendar years; or

b. Is included in a corporate settlement agreement requiring appropriate
 management systems for process safety; or

c. Is a VPP participant; or

d. Is a corporate office/headquarters and is not engaged in actual production
 or physical research operations; or

e. Has been identified in the wrong SIC code or is out of business; or

f. Is not covered because of exclusions in the PSM standard; or

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 15

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *

[Replacement page 12]

g.
Has been the subject of a PSM-related inspection (complaint or referral) in
the preceding year during which PSM programs were screened and a
referral for a PQV inspection was not made.

NOTE: Determination for deletion shall be made initially, to the extent
possible, at the National Office level when the list is prepared; and/or
subsequently, as necessary, at the Regional Office level based on local
knowledge (e.g., recent inspections, Area Office screening, State
Manufacturers' Guide).

5.  Local Emphasis Programs. Some Regions may have relatively few
establishments in the targeted SIC codes listed in Appendix C. Regional
Administrators therefore may propose a Local Emphasis Program to direct
Regional PSM inspections resources to industry types that may not be covered by
the targeted SIC codes. Such Local Emphasis Programs shall be submitted to the
Directorate of Compliance Programs for approval in accordance with the FOM,
Chapter II.

K.  Scope of PQV Inspection. Comprehensive inspections under the PSM standard shall
evaluate the procedures used by the employer and the process-related contract employers
to manage the hazards associated with processes using highly hazardous chemicals.
Normally, these inspections will embody a three-fold approach, which for reference is
termed *Program-Quality-Verification* (PQV).

1.  First, the employer's and the contract employers' *Program* for complying with
each of the listed elements of the PSM standard shall be evaluated in accordance
with the PSM Audit Guidelines contained in Appendix A of this instruction. (See
also M. of this instruction.)

2.  Second, the *Quality* of the employer's and the contract employers' procedures
shall be compared to acceptable industry practices as described in the standard to
determine compliance.

3.  Third, *Verification* of the employer's and the contract employers' effective
implementation of the program can be made through review of written programs
and records of activity, interviews with employees at different

[Replacement page 13]

levels, and observation of site conditions. The team leader shall select one or
more processes as described at L.7. of this instruction to perform the verification
portion of the inspection.

L. **PQV Inspection Procedures.** The procedures given in the FOM, Chapter III, shall be
followed except as modified in the following sections:

1. **Opening Conference.** Where appropriate, the facility safety and health director,
Process Safety Manager, or other person capable of explaining the company's
Process Safety Management Program shall be included in the opening conference.

    a. During the opening conference, CSHOs shall familiarize themselves with
    the establishment's emergency response procedures and emergency
    alarms.

    b. CSHOs shall also request that the management representative(s) provide
    them with a reasonably detailed overview of the chemical (and, where
    applicable, explosives) process and/or manufacturing operations at the
    facility, including block flow and/or process flow diagrams indicating
    chemicals and processes involved.

2. **PSM Overview.** Prior to beginning the walkaround inspection, the CSHOs shall
request an explanation of the company's Process Safety Management Program
including, at a minimum:

    a. How the elements of the standard are implemented;

    b. Personnel designated as responsible for implementation of the various
    elements of the standard; and

    c. A description of company records used to verify compliance with the
    standard.

3. **Initial Walkaround.** After this familiarization, the inspection may begin with a
brief walkaround inspection of those portions of the facility within the scope of
the standard. Additional walkaround activity may be necessary after selection of
the process unit(s). The purpose of the initial walkaround is to:

[Replacement page 14]

a. Give CSHOs a basic overview of the facility operations;

b. Allow CSHOs to observe potential hazards such as pipework in risk of impact, corroded or leaking equipment, unit or control room siting, and location of relief devices; and

c. Solicit input from the employee representative concerning potential PSM program deficiencies.

4. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). In addition to normal inspection protective equipment, CSHOs conducting these inspections shall be provided with flame retardant coveralls for protection from flash fires and with NIOSH- approved emergency escape respirators for use during any emergency conditions. PPE shall be appropriate to the environment at the workplace. Special equipment will be necessary in environments containing explosive materials.

APPENDIX A

PSM AUDIT GUIDELINES

Purpose.

This appendix contains audit guidelines intended to assist the CSHO in investigating an employer's compliance with the PSM standard. It shall be used in conjunction with Appendix B, Clarifications and Interpretations of the PSM Standard, as the primary source of compliance guidance on 29 CFR 1910.119.

Structure.

The guidelines present a Program Summary, Quality Criteria References, and a Verification checklist for each of the PSM elements.

1.  Guidelines for paragraphs **c, g, h, k, m, and n** are designed so that CSHOs who may not be specifically trained in chemical process plants or in the PSM standard can make a preliminary review of the required elements.

2.  Guidelines for elements **d, e, f, i, j, l, o, and p** are oriented toward more detailed investigations.

Use of the Verification Checklist.

The verification of each program element is divided into three parts: Records Review, On-Site Conditions and Interviews.

1.  The Records Review section describes the documentation of the programs as required by the PSM standard. During a preliminary inspection, the CSHO shall review the documentation for the entire PSM program to ascertain that all of the elements are developed.

2.  Sections labeled On-Site Conditions and Interviews guide the CSHO in confirming that the programs are implemented. This confirmation involves observing conditions and procedures, and interviewing the operators, maintenance personnel, engineering support staff, contractors and contractor employees, as appropriate, to determine whether the implemented program matches the program outlined by the documentation.

NOTE: Several questions in the "Interviews" sections refer to interviewing engineers. The PSM standard does not require an employer to employ engineers,

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 25

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Replacement page A-2]

and these questions should not be construed as imposing a new requirement that an employer do
so. All questions in this appendix that refer to interviews of engineers shall be understood to
mean "engineers, if any, or other qualified persons capable of providing the information
requested."

3. The CSHO shall initially perform a representative number of observations and interviews for
elements c, g, h, k, m, and n. A more detailed investigation will cover all 14 elements. During
these detailed assessments, the CSHO shall review components from a representative number of
processes, if multiple processes exist. To confirm implementation, the CSHO shall compare the
conditions and the interview results with both the minimum requirements of the PSM standard
and the program outlined by the employer's documents.

**Audit Guideline Documentation.**

As noted at P.2. of the body of this instruction, the Audit Guidelines are constructed as a series
of questions relating to each of the pertinent provisions of the standard.

1.  The questions are designed to elicit a determination of "Yes" or "No" by the CSHO as to
whether compliance with the provision has been met. This shall be indicated in the column
labeled Met Y/N. A "Y" or "Yes" in this column indicates the subsection meets requirements. An
"N" or "No" indicates the employer does not meet the standard and an "NA" signifies that the
subsection does not apply.

2. A determination of "No" for any provision indicates noncompliance; thus, any "No" shall
normally result in a citation for a violation of that provision.

3. The CSHO shall thoroughly document each such determination in the case file.

The Field Note Reference(s) space is used to cross-reference the PSM subsection with the
CSHO's field notes. Field notes need not be rewritten when using these guidelines. The CSHO
may record field note page numbers, videotape frame identification, photograph identification,
and other documentation that refers to the requirements of the standard's elements.

[Replacement page A-3]

Basic Audit Information.

In order to gather the information needed to audit the program, the CSHO shall answer the
following questions for each element:
Who? What? When? Where? Why? and How?

1. Who are the officials responsible for developing and implementing each of the program
elements?

2. What are the requirements and the contents of each program element?

3. When are the required actions for each element completed and when are they required to be
completed?

4. Where have actions been implemented or changed?

5. Why have the implementation decisions and priorities been made as recorded in the PSM
documentation?

6. How is the program implemented and how is the program's effectiveness evaluated and
improved (monitoring performance, follow-up and closure of outstanding items, etc.)?

Interrelationship of Elements.

An essential part of verifying program implementation is to audit the flow of information and
activities among the elements. When information in one element is changed or when action takes
place in one element that affects other elements, the CSHO shall review a sample of the related
elements to see if the appropriate changes and follow-up actions have taken place.

The following example demonstrates the interrelationship among the elements:
During a routine inspection of equipment (Mechanical Integrity), the maintenance worker
discovers a valve that no longer meets the applicable code and must be changed. Because the
type of valve is no longer made, a different type of valve must be selected and installed
(Management of Change). The type of valve selected may mandate different steps for the
operators (Operating Procedures) who will require training and verification in the new
procedures (Training). The rationale for selecting the type of valve

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 27

NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Replacement page A-4]

must be made available for review by employees and their representatives (Employee
Participation).

When the new valve is installed by the supplier (Contractors), it will involve shutting down part
of the process (Pre-startup Safety Review) as well as brazing some of the lines (Hot Work
Permit). The employer must review the response plan (Emergency Planning) to ensure that
procedures are adequate for the installation hazards.

Although Management of Change provisions cover interim changes, after the new valve is in
place the Process Safety Information will have to be updated before the Process Hazard
Analysis is updated or revalidated, to account for potential hazards associated with the new
equipment. Also, inspection and maintenance procedures and training will need to be updated
(Mechanical Integrity).

In summary, 11 PSM elements can be affected by changing one valve. A CSHO would check a
representative number of these 11 elements to confirm that the required follow-up activities have
been implemented for the new valve.

Three key elements shall be routinely reviewed to verify that changes have been implemented.
They are:

*   Operating Procedures;

*   Process Hazard Analysis; and

*   Training.

These elements shall be crosschecked to see if they show that the changes have been followed
through to completion.

Appendix B

Clarifications and Interpretations of the PSM Standard

The guidance contained in this appendix is provided for compliance assistance. It shall be
followed in interpreting the PSM standard for compliance purposes. Unless otherwise noted, all
paragraph citations refer to 29 CFR 1910.119.

This appendix contains clarifications agreed to in a settlement agreement dated April 5, 1993,
between OSHA, the United Steelworkers of America, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
International Union, and the Building and Construction Trades Department of the AFL-CIO. The
settlement agreement clarifications reflect modifications jointly and cooperatively agreed to by
the above parties and by the Chemical Manufacturers Association, the American Petroleum
Institute, the Dow Chemical Company, and the National Petroleum Refiners Association.

Where possible, clarifications and interpretations have been presented in a question-and-answer
format.

NOTE: OSHA plans to include additional clarifications and interpretations in this appendix
through future page changes to this instruction.

(a) Application

(a) Registration

Do covered establishments have to register with OSHA?
No. There is no requirement that establishments covered by the standard register with or
otherwise notify OSHA.

(a) Explosives--fireworks manufacture

How does the PSM standard apply to pyrotechnics (fireworks) and explosives?
The PSM standard amended the scope of 29 CFR 1910.109, Explosives and blasting agents,
by revising paragraph (k),

[Replacement page B-2]

which requires that the manufacturer of explosives and pyrotechnics comply with 29 CFR 1910.119. As defined at 1910.109(a)(10), pyrotechnics are commonly referred to as fireworks. Employers who manufacture explosives and fireworks must comply with both 29 CFR 1910.109 and 1910.119.

The applicability of 29 CFR 1910.109 to employers who manufacture fireworks is delineated in OSHA Instruction CPL 2.73, Fireworks Manufacturers: Compliance Policy. In accordance with that directive, a fireworks plant employer can be cited for violation of 29 CFR 1910.109 with reference to certain National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards in NFPA 1124, Code for the Manufacture, Transportation and Storage of Fireworks.

What is the role of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) vis-a-vis the PSM standard and fireworks manufacture?

By 27 CFR 55 Subpart K, BATF regulates the storage, including minimum distances, of explosive materials including fireworks in the workplace. As such, BATF limits the amount of special fireworks, pyrotechnic composition, and explosive materials used to assemble fireworks in processing building to no more than 500 pounds. Also, the maximum quantity of flash powder permitted by BATF in any fireworks process building is 10 pounds. These BATF limitations should not be confused with the applicability of the PSM standard to any amount of fireworks being manufactured.

(a) Laboratories

Does the PSM standard apply to laboratory and research operations?

A laboratory or research operation involving at least the threshold quantity of one or more highly hazardous chemicals is subject to the PSM standard.

[Replacement page B-3]

(a) Flammable liquids

Are processes involving flammable liquids (e.g., ethyl alcohol) covered by the standard?
Processes involving {flammable liquids with a flashpoint below 100 °F, as determined in accordance with Appendix B to §1910.1200, *Physical Hazard Criteria*, paragraph B.6.3,}
(e.g., in a distillation process) in quantities at or above 10,000 lbs. are covered. Quantities of flammable liquids in storage are considered a part of the process if the storage tanks are interconnected with the process, or if they are sufficiently near the process that an explosion, fire, or release could reasonably involve the storage area combined with the process in quantities sufficient to meet the threshold amount of 10,000 lbs.

Flammable liquids that are stored on a tank farm (e.g., a wholesale gasoline regional tank farm) where only transferring and storage are done are not covered by the PSM standard. They are, however, covered under 1910.106.

(a)(1)(i) Hydrogen chloride (HCL)

Does the PSM standard apply to muriatic (32% HCL) acid?
The chemical names: hydrogen chloride (HCL) and anhydrous hydrochloric acid are included in the highly hazardous chemicals listing in Appendix A of the PSM standard. Anhydrous (without water) hydrochloric acid is hydrogen chloride. Both hydrogen chloride and anhydrous hydrochloric acid are identified by the same Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Number 7647-01-0, as denoted in Appendix A. Hydrochloric acid (muriatic acid)--i.e., a solution of hydrogen chloride gas in water--is not listed in Appendix A and therefore is not considered to be a highly hazardous chemical subject to the PSM standard.

(a)(1)(i) Highly hazardous chemicals (HHCS)

What is meant by "Formaldehyde (Formalin)" listed in Appendix A of the PSM standard?
This highly hazardous chemical should be listed to read: Formaldehyde (37% by weight or greater). The PSM standard will be revised to reflect this change in the near future. Any amount of mixture of Formaldehyde, less than 37% by

[Replacement page B-4]

weight, in solution would not be covered by the PSM standard.

Does the PSM standard apply to solutions of Dimethylamine?

Anhydrous Dimethylamine, identified by Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Number 124-40-3, is listed in Appendix A of the PSM Standard as a highly hazardous chemical.

Dimethylamine in aqueous solutions, which is not listed in Appendix A, is not considered to be a highly hazardous chemical covered by the PSM standard except when the solution qualifies as a flammable liquid.

(a)(1)(i) HHCs--mixtures

Does the threshold quantity listed under Appendix A of the PSM standard apply to the quantity of the whole mixture or just the quantity of the component chemical, or to neither (i.e., does the threshold quantity apply only to quantities of pure chemical unless otherwise specified in the appendix)?

The threshold quantities listed in Appendix A of the standard apply only to pure (or "commercial grade") chemicals unless otherwise specified, for example, Hydrogen Peroxide, 52% by weight or greater.

Does the PSM standard apply to an employer who uses cellulose nitrate in a concentration greater than 12.6% nitrogen to which water is added, producing a mixture containing greater than 23% water, which will not burn?

Appendix A of the standard lists cellulose nitrate in concentrations of greater than 12.6% nitrogen as a chemical which presents a potential for a catastrophic event at or above the threshold quantity of 2500 pounds (1,133.9 kg). The standard does not distinguish between "wet" or "dry" cellulose nitrate.

Therefore, if an employer's process involves cellulose nitrate in a concentration greater than 12.6% nitrogen, with the total quantity of the mixture or solution at or above the threshold quantity--no matter what percentage of water may be used in treatment--the process is covered under the requirements of the PSM standard.

[Replacement page B-5]

(a)(1)(i) and (b) Covered process--Hazardous waste operations

Does the PSM standard apply to the EPA-regulated and permitted RCRA hazardous waste
treatment, storage and disposal (TSD) facilities, when such facilities keep on-site in one
location a hazardous waste chemical in a concentration and quantity which exceeds the
applicable threshold quantity of Appendix A. If so, why? If not, why not?
Employers of worksites with TSD facilities which contain covered processes must comply
with the PSM standard. The requirements of the PSM standard are intended to eliminate or
mitigate workplace catastrophic releases of highly hazardous chemicals and resulting
employee exposure to explosion, fire and toxic hazards.

(a)(1)(i) and (b) Covered process--dispersal of inventory

Can an employer who keeps threshold quantities of highly hazardous chemicals listed in
Appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.119, such as ammonia, separated into smaller lots and used
and stored in separate systems or locations, be exempt from the requirements of the PSM
standard?
From a storage standpoint, the 1910.119 standard would not apply to an employer who
segregates his inventory by dispersing storage of highly hazardous chemicals, such as
ammonia, in amounts which do not exceed the threshold quantity so that a release from one
storage area would not contribute to or cause a release from others around the workplace.
Additionally, an employer could reduce his on-site inventory of highly hazardous chemicals
by ordering more frequent, smaller shipments so that they do not exceed the threshold
quantities set forth in the PSM Standard.

The PSM standard's non-mandatory Appendix C suggests that, if reduced inventory of
highly hazardous chemicals is not feasible, an employer might consider dispersing
inventory to several locations on-site. When are such materials to be considered part of a
single process?
Under the definition of "process" provided at 29 CFR 1910.119(b), any group of vessels
which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a highly hazardous
chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.
Inventories of highly hazardous chemicals would not be considered to be adequately

[Replacement page B-6]

dispersed if the storage vessels are connected with or in proximity to a covered process such
that they could be involved in a potential release.

What evaluation techniques are appropriate to determine adequate separation distances?
OSHA has not developed, nor is it aware of, any standard evaluation technique to determine
adequate distances to separate chemical inventories. If an employer chooses to disperse
highly hazardous chemicals on-site, the separation distances would have to be determined on
a case-by-case basis, considering such factors as the nature of the chemicals and covered
processes, total inventories, threshold quantities of pertinent chemicals, and facility layout.

(a)(1)(ii) Application--55-gallon drums

Would more than 10,000 pounds (4535.9 kg) of a flammable liquid stored together in 55-
gallon (209-liter) drums be covered under the PSM standard?
For the purposes of the PSM standard, this would be considered exempt as storage in
atmospheric tanks (notwithstanding the definitions of "containers" and "tanks" in 29 CFR
1910.106), unless the drums are near a covered process, as described in the Q & A on
"flammable liquids" at page B-2 of this appendix. For the purposes of 1910.106, 55-gallon
(209-liter) drums are covered in the definition of "container."

(a)(1)(ii) Covered Process--Flammable gases

For processes involving flammable gas mixtures, are the non flammable components in a
flammable gas mixture included when determining the threshold quantity?
The non-flammable components contribute to the determination of threshold quantity, i.e.,
10,000 pounds (4535.9 kg) or greater amounts of {a flammable gas, as defined in 29 CFR
1910.1200(c) and in Appendix B to §1910.1200, *Physical Hazard Criteria*, as a Category 1
flammable gas, } and noted below:

(a) A gas that at ambient temperatures and pressure forms a flammable mixture with air at a
concentration of thirteen (13) percent by volume or less; or

(b) A gas that, at ambient temperature and pressure, forms a range of flammable mixtures
with air wider than twelve (12) percent by volume, regardless of the lower limit.

(a)(1)(ii) Covered process--Flammable liquids

Does the PSM standard apply to processes in a paint manufacturing facility, which include
the mixing and blending of flammable liquids with other raw materials, and which
typically involve few or no chemical reactions? Typically, the flammable products are
processed below their normal boiling points and that several large batch vessels are located
near each other, with an aggregate weight above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds
(4535.9 kilograms).

The requirements of the PSM standard would apply to such operations. The exemption
provided in the standard at 1910.119(a)(1)(ii)(B) for situations involving {flammable liquids
with a flash point below 100 °F, as determined in accordance with the methods in Appendix
B to §1910.1200, *Physical Hazard Criteria*, paragraph B.6.3,} applies only when such
liquids are being stored in atmospheric tanks (where the tank pressure does not exceed 0.5
pounds per square inch gauge [p.s.i.g.]) or transferred and the liquids are kept below their
normal boiling point without benefit of chilling or refrigeration. This exemption does not
apply to a mixing and blending operation related to paint manufacturing.

(a)(1)(ii)(A) Application--Exceptions--Hydrocarbon fuels

Does the PSM standard apply to ceramic manufacturing facilities utilizing propane in
amounts exceeding 10,000 pounds as the fuel for firing ceramic ware in a process which
does not involve any other highly hazardous chemicals?
No. The PSM standard would not apply to such a situation.

Does gasoline used as a fuel to test run inboard and outboard engines fall within the scope
of the PSM standard?
Gasoline used in such a manner does not fall within the scope of 1910.119, because it is used
as a fuel in this situation and thus meets the exception at

[Replacement page B-8]

1910.119(a)(1)(ii)(A). However, other OSHA standards, {such as 1910.106, Flammable and
combustible liquids}, would apply.

Does the PSM standard apply to a plant that has more than 10,000 pounds of hydrocarbon
fuel on site where the fuel is used solely as a fuel for a furnace used to melt glass?
The requirements of 1910.119 do not apply to this situation because 1910.119(a)(1)(ii)(A) of
the standard specifically excludes from coverage hydrocarbon fuels used solely for
workplace consumption as a fuel if the fuel is not part of a process containing another highly
hazardous chemical covered by the standard.

(a)(1)(ii)(A) Tote tanks

350-gallon tote tanks containing flammable liquids are used at a facility to refuel vehicles.
Are they covered by the standard?
No. 1910.119(a)(1)(ii)(A) exempts hydrocarbon fuels used solely for workplace consumption
as a fuel (e.g., gasoline for vehicle refueling) if such fuels are not part of a process containing
another highly hazardous chemical covered by the standard. They are, however, covered
under 1910.106.

(a)(1)(ii)(A) Fuels for heating

Are flammable liquids and gases used as fuels for such items as heaters or exchanges
contained in (covered) processes also included within the coverage of the standard?
Furnaces, boilers, heaters, etc., fueled by flammable liquids or gases--regardless of the
quantity of the fuel--used in processes that are otherwise covered by the PSM standard (i.e.,
the existence of a threshold quantity of another highly hazardous chemical) are considered
part of the process and are covered by the PSM standard. Flammable liquid-or-gas-fueled
furnaces, boilers, etc., used in processes not otherwise covered by the PSM standard are
exempt from the standard.

[Replacement page B-9]

(a)(1)(ii)(B) Tank farms

Are flammable liquids stored in a tank farm covered under the standard?
Atmospheric tanks containing flammable liquids at bulk transfer terminals are not covered.
However, atmospheric tanks containing {flammable liquids with a flashpoint below 100 °F,
as determined in accordance with Appendix B to §1910.1200, *Physical Hazard Criteria*, paragraph B.6.3,} that have feeder connections to processes *are* covered by the standard.
EXAMPLE. Atmospheric tanks in an outside storage area contain a flammable liquid that is
pumped to a mixing vessel. If the total quantity of flammable liquids in this equipment is at
or above 10,000 pounds (4535.9 kg), then this is a covered process which includes, at a
minimum, the storage tanks, the piping, and the mixing vessel.

(a)(1)(ii)(B) Flammable liquids

Does 1910.119(a)(1)(ii)(B) exempt all flammable liquids stored or transferred which are
kept below their normal boiling point without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration,
including, but not limited to, flammable liquids in atmospheric tanks?
No. The exemption is limited to {flammable liquids with a flashpoint below 100 °F, as
determined in accordance with Appendix B to §1910.1200, *Physical Hazard Criteria*, paragraph B.6.3,} stored in atmospheric tanks or transferred which are kept below their
normal boiling point without benefit of chilling or refrigeration. This exemption is applicable
to flammable liquids in tanks, containers and pipes used only for storage and transfer (to
storage), and not connected to a process or a process vessel. Similarly, stored flammable
liquids in containers, including cans, barrels and drums, would be exempt from coverage by
the PSM standard. We recommend you carefully consider the definition of "process" to
determine further applicability of the PSM standard in situations where flammable liquids are
stored in tanks or containers at a worksite.

(a)(2)(i) Retail facilities

What is the definition of "retail facilities" that are exempted from coverage by the PSM
standard?
With respect to enforcement of the PSM standard, a retail facility means an establishment
that would otherwise be

[Replacement page B-10]

subject to the PSM standard at which more than half of the income is obtained from direct
sales to end users.

If an employer that would otherwise be covered by the PSM standard operates at several
locations and the majority of its income comes from sales to end users, is the employer
exempt as a "retail facility"?
The PSM standard defines a retail facility as "an establishment which would otherwise be
subject to the PSM standard, at which more than half of the income is obtained from direct
sales to end users." If such an employer operates at multiple locations, the questions becomes
whether this constitutes a single "establishment" for the purposes of the standard.

The intent of the PSM Standard is to prevent catastrophic releases of highly hazardous
chemicals, thereby, providing for safe and healthful workplaces for employees. Consistent
with this intent, the term "establishment," when used to define retail facility, means a
company name at a specific site (normally with a street address). Thus, if an employer
operates at several locations, some might be covered by the standard, and others not affected.

Are facilities that fill propane tanks for "will call" type customers exempt from the PSM
standard? Most of these facilities are under the aggregate quantity of 10,000 pounds
(4535.9 kilograms), The majority of the business is transferring propane from the supply
tank to small containers for barbecues and "RV" units.
Such facilities appear to be exempt from coverage by the PSM standard because they are
retail facilities or because they do not involve processes with threshold (or greater) quantities
of propane. A retail facility is defined as a site-specific establishment which otherwise would
be subject to the PSM standard, at which more than half of the income is obtained from direct
sales to end users.

(a)(2)(ii) Oil or gas well operations

Are single well processing facilities with equipment including separators, heat-treaters and storage tanks used in gas production (from non-H2S containing petroleum fluids) operations exempt from coverage under 1910.119(a)(2)(ii), which excludes oil and gas well drilling and servicing operations?
The 1910.119(a)(ii) exemption of oil or gas well drilling or servicing operations is intended to cover all drilling operations and any well servicing operation including acidizing.
Additionally, water separation facilities adjacent to or near the well (including tanks used primarily for water separation in conjunction with oil or gas well production) are not normally covered by the PSM standard.

The following processes, when they involve at least threshold quantities of oil or gas, are covered by the PSM standard. Oil or gas well production fluids from several wells are processed by heating the fluids and physically separating the water from the gas or oil. The water is returned to the ground via a "down hole well" for disposal return to the strata from which it came. But if these oil or gas well drilling operations take place at "normally unoccupied remote facilities", then according to 1910.119(a)(2)(iii), they are exempt from PSM standard coverage.

(a)(2)(iii) Meaning of "facility"

Can a facility contain more than one process?
A facility can include multiple processes. If multiple processes are interconnected, they may be considered a single process for purposes of the standard.

(b) Definitions

(b) "Process"

What are "aggregate threshold quantities"?
In accordance with the second sentence of the definition of "process," quantities of a particular hazardous chemical

[Replacement page B-12]

contained in vessels that are interconnected--and in unconnected vessels that may be
adversely affected due to an incident at a nearby process--must be combined to determine
whether the threshold level of a hazardous chemical has been reached. If the threshold level
is exceeded by the combination of the amount in separate tanks and interconnected vessels,
then all of these may be considered one process.

Is waste burning of covered solvents considered a process?
Yes.

(b) "Hot work"
"Spark-producing operations" include operations which use flame-or spark-producing
equipment--such as grinders, welding, burning, or brazing--that are capable of igniting
flammable vapors or gases.

(b) "Normally unoccupied remote facility"
"Normally unoccupied remote facility" means that employees are not permanently
stationed at the remote location. This includes those sites for which periodic visits by
employees may be made on a scheduled basis. Examples could include pump stations located
miles from the main establishment. Employees may be assigned to check on the station as
needed.

The intent behind "remote" is that, due to the isolation of the process from employees by
distance, such employees would not be affected by the consequences of a catastrophic
release. Therefore, the remote location must be geographically separated from other facilities
and employees such that employees would not be affected by an explosion, vapor cloud of
toxic gas, or other consequence of an uncontrolled release at the remote site.

(c) Employee participation

(c) Employee participation

In implementing employee participation as required by 1910.119 (c) of the PSM standard, can an employer mandate that employees e.g., top operators of process units--provide the company with information such as step-by-step procedures for routine tasks performed on their operating units? Can the employer threaten disciplinary action for employees who do not cooperate?

The employee participation called for at 1910.119(c) is intended to provide for a cooperative participatory environment and necessary flow of information from management to employees and from employees to management on process safety to eliminate or mitigate the consequences of catastrophic releases of highly hazardous chemicals in the workplace. Paragraph 1910.119(c)(2) contains language taken from the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. As prescribed by the CAAA, the standard at 1910.119(c)(3) requires that PSM information developed by the employer be made available to employees and their representatives. Also, OSHA requires that an employer carefully consider and structure the plant's approach to employee involvement in the PSM program.

The plan-of-action standard at 1910.119(c)(1) is intended to address this issue to ensure that the employer actively considers the appropriate method of employee participation in the implementation of the PSM program in the workplace.

(c)(2) Consultation

What does consult mean? Can the employer simply inform the employees?

Consultation refers to a two-way dialogue between the employer and the employees and their representatives (where they exist), in which the employer elicits, and responds to, employees' concerns and suggestions bearing upon the elements of process safety management required under this standard. Consultation is therefore more than a way to inform employees about aspects of process safety; it is a process of seeking advice, criticisms, and suggestions from employees and their representatives.

[Replacement page B-14]

1.  The employer should establish a method for informing all employees and their
representatives that their process safety concerns and suggestions are welcome. The
employer must also establish a mechanism by which it will respond, orally or in
writing, to such concerns and suggestions.

2.  In addition, the employer should affirmatively solicit the suggestions and concerns of
employees and their representatives, who, by virtue of their job responsibilities, actual
knowledge, or representative positions, can reasonably be expected to make
substantive contributions to the development and evaluation of specific elements of
process safety management.

The standard requires employers to consult with "employees and their representatives." Is
the term broad enough to include a representative of the international union? A consultant
designated by the union local or international?

The standard requires consultation with "employees and their representatives". The term
"employee representative" is intended to mean union representative where a union exists,
or an employee designated representative in the absence of a union. The term is to be
construed broadly, and may include the local union, the international union, or an individual
designated by these parties, such as the safety and health committee representative at the site
or a non-employee consultant. In the absence of a union, employees have a right under the
standard to designate a representative to participate in the consultation process.

With respect to the PHA team, in all cases it must consist of one or more persons
knowledgeable about the process. The intent of the consultation requirement at
1910.119(c)(2) is not to compel the inclusion of any person(s) who are not knowledgeable;
ideally, the employer and employees/employee representatives should reach a consensus on
including the most capable parties.

(c)(2) Consultation--contractors

Must the employer consult with employees of contractors?

A host employer must consult with employees of covered contractors and their
representatives, to the same extent

[Replacement page B-15]

that it must consult with similarly situated direct hire employees. Therefore, the host
employer must establish a method for informing all contractor employees and their
representatives that their process safety concerns and suggestions are welcome, and will be
responded to. In addition, the following non-exclusive examples illustrate circumstances
under which the host employer may be required to solicit the advice and suggestions of
specific contractor employees about specific aspects of process safety:

1.  Contract employees who function as process operators on covered processes, or
    perform routine maintenance on covered processes, should be consulted to the same
    extent as equivalent direct hire operating and maintenance employees, respectively.

2.  Contract employees who routinely interface with a host employer's Management of
    Change program should be consulted on the effectiveness of the program as it relates
    to their jobs and based upon their interaction with it.

3.  Contract employees who routinely participate in activities pursuant to mechanical
    integrity should be consulted on the effectiveness of the program as it relates to their
    jobs and based upon their interaction with it; e.g., contract employees should be
    encouraged to identify any deficiencies they observe in the host employer' s program.

4.  Contract employees who have unique experience or knowledge concerning the
    operation, maintenance, or safe performance of any portion of a covered process
    should be consulted, as appropriate, on that portion of the process during the PHA.

5.  Contract employees who routinely interface with the host employer's safe work
    practices (such as, for example, the employer's lockout/tagout rules, hot work permit
    procedures, and confined space entry procedures) should be consulted as to the
    effectiveness of those practices.

Host employers can consult with contractor employees and their representatives directly, or
through the contractor employer. Contractor employers share responsibility for ensuring that
there is consultation with their employees.

[Replacement page B-16]

(c)(3) Access

What does "access" mean? Does this mean simply make it available at a central location?
Does the employer have to make copies for employees if requested?
The intent of access under this standard is for the information to be made available for
employees and their representatives in a reasonable manner. Reasonable access may require
providing copies or loaning documents. The trade secret provision of the standard permits the
employer to require confidentiality agreements before providing the information.

(c)(3) Equal access to information
Under (c)(3), the employer is required to provide access to process hazard analyses and all
other information to be developed under this standard to employees of covered contractors, to
the same extent that it must provide access to direct hire employees, if similarly situated.
Contract employers share responsibility for assuring that their employees are provided with
the requested information.

(d) Process safety information

(d) Retention of information

How long must the employer maintain process safety information?
In order to demonstrate compliance with this paragraph, and to meet the purpose of the
standard, the process safety information is to be kept for the lifetime of the process, and
updated whenever changes other than "replacement in kind" are made.

(d)(2)(ii) Original process safety information not present

If process safety information on the original technology does not exist, what must the
employer do?
The employer must obtain or generate the missing information. If the information on the
original technology

[Replacement page B-17]

does not exist, then the employer may delay the development of this information until the
process hazard analysis (PHA) is initiated, but in no case later than the applicable dates
specified at 1910.119(e)(1). However, the other information required by this section must be
compiled before conducting any PHA. The information on the technology must be gathered
as the PHAs are conducted in accordance with the priority schedule developed by the
employer.

(d)(3)(iii) Older codes--PSM standard deadlines

For equipment based on old design codes, the employer must determine and document that
the equipment is designed and operated safely. By what date must the employer do this?
Specifically:

*   When must the employer determine adequacy of design based on old codes, and

*   How much time does the employer have to make corrections?

Generally speaking, the time frames which apply to implementation of the PHAs also apply
to this paragraph.

Such documentation must be completed either before or in conjunction with the development
of the PHA, except where a pre-startup safety review is required, in which case the
documentation must be completed before startup. For older equipment, this may require
verification that the design and construction are safe for the intended application. Where
corrective action is required as a result of the PHA, it must be completed as soon as possible
pursuant to paragraph (e)(5).

EXCEPTION: For actions required by a pre-startup safety review (see (i)(2)), such
corrective action must be implemented prior to the startup if the correction is safety-critical.

[Replacement page B-18]

(e) Process hazard analysis

(e)(1) PHA priority

What rationale must employers use to determine the priority for conducting the process
hazard analyses? May the rationale include age, history, extent of employee exposure, etc.?
The appropriate priority for conducting PHAs is to be determined by using all of the criteria
identified in this paragraph, e.g., extent of the process hazards (catastrophic potential), age of
the process, number of potentially exposed employees, and operating history. Other
appropriate factors may also be considered in establishing the priority. The documentation
required by this paragraph shall demonstrate the underlying rationale for the prioritization.

(e)(1) PHA priority--"as soon as possible"
Paragraph (e) contains a five year phased-in compliance schedule for completing process
hazard analyses. The provision mandates that employers first "determine and document the
priority order for conducting process hazard analyses" and then complete 25 percent or more
of the analyses each year after the second year. (See 57 Fed. Reg. 6378/3.) However, because
OSHA believes that "plants with a limited number of processes, with simple processes, or
which have already completed a number of process hazard analyses" will need less time to
complete their analyses (57 Fed. Reg. 6375/3), it included a specific provision requiring that
analyses "be completed as soon as possible." 29 C.F.R. 1910.119(e)(1)

(e)(1) PHA completion dates

What is the time frame for completion of the initial PHAs and for updating and
revalidating them?
In accordance with 1910.119(e)(1), all initial PHAs must be completed as soon as possible,
with at least 25 percent of them completed by May 26, 1994; 50 percent by May 26, 1995; 75
percent by May 26, 1996; and all completed by May 26, 1997. Initial PHAs must be updated
and revalidated at least every 5 years thereafter (see 1910.119(e)(6). When

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 103

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *

[Replacement page B-19]

employers update and revalidate a PHA before the 5-year deadline, the subsequent update
and revalidation must be completed within the next 5-year period.

(e)(1) PHAs--Required site-by-site?

If a natural gas company has five sites with facilities performing the same process, does a
separate PHA need to be performed for each site, for each facility at these sites, or for each
process at each facility?

The PSM Standard is applicable, on a site-by-site basis, to each worksite which has one or
more facilities containing one or more processes involving one or more of the covered highly
hazardous chemicals. A worksite may be simply one facility containing a single process. (See
the definition of "facility" in Subsection (b) of 1910.119). On the other hand, a worksite may
be a complex of facilities, each containing one or more processes.

Under 1910.119(e)(1), employers are required to perform initial PHAs on processes involving
highly hazardous chemicals covered by the PSM standard. An employer may use a generic
hazard analysis approach for the same (or nearly the same) covered process at an individual
worksite. The employer must account for variations (e.g., differences in siting, incident
histories, technology, equipment, or operations) for each process covered by this generic
approach. Generic process hazard analysis is addressed in section 4. of nonmandatory
Appendix C of 1910.119, Compliance Guidelines and Recommendation for Process Safety
Management.

(e)(2) Process hazard analysis--"appropriate methodology"

What type of methodology must employers use in the PHA in order to be sure it is
"appropriate"?

Employers are expected to use sound judgment, on a case-by case basis, to determine an
appropriate methodology for the process hazard analysis for each covered process. It is not
the intent of the standard to require a PHA methodology that is excessively burdensome, but
rather one that is appropriate and which will have the capability to elicit all hazards, defects,
failure possibilities, etc., for the

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *

[Replacement page B-20]

process being analyzed, and also have the capability to address all the factors at
1910.119(e)(3).

(e)(3) Meaning of "control"

The regulation requires that the PHA address the "control" of the hazards. What is meant
by: "identification, evaluation, and control of process hazards"--?
The PHA is intended to identify and evaluate acceptable controls for process hazards. The
evaluation of the hazards must include all the steps set out in section (e)(3)(i)-vii), using a
methodology consistent with section (e)(2). Through the timely resolution of the PHA
findings and recommendations, the PHA is intended to control process hazards.

(e)(3)(iv) Quantitative determination?

Must the employer make a quantitative determination to determine the consequences of
failure of the controls?
The intent of this paragraph is to require the employer to at least identify each type of control
as well as identify the possible effects of the failure of the listed control. OSHA believes
employers can determine the consequences of a failure of these controls, and establish a
reasonable estimate of the safety and health effects on employees without conducting a
specialized quantitative evaluation.

(e)(3)(v) Facility siting

What does "facility siting" mean?
With respect to existing plants, "siting" does not refer to the site of the plant in relation to the
surrounding community. It refers, rather, to the location of various components within the
establishment.

(e)(5) Abatement = shutdown?

Hazards may be identified for which a recommended solution/action might be the
shutdown of the process. For example, several processes might be located very close, and if
fire were to occur

[Replacement page B-21]

a domino effect might result in a catastrophic release. The resolution may be to separate
the processes, but there is no additional property on which to expand. What is required of
the employer?
In such situations, the employer could implement protective measures to minimize the
probability of a major uncontrolled release. An appropriate response in this specific case, for
example, might be to install additional detection systems which may be interlocked to deluge
systems for tanks and process equipment, to provide additional protective measures for onsite
personnel, and to implement administrative controls, such as reducing inventories and
numbers of exposed personnel.

(e)(5) Timeliness

Employers must "promptly" address the problems identified in the PHA in a "timely
manner," and complete actions "as soon as possible." What time frame did OSHA intend
here?
The standard's intent is for the employer to take corrective action as soon as possible. As
soon as possible means that the employer shall proceed with all due speed, considering the
complexity of the recommendation and the difficulty of implementation. OSHA expects
employers to develop a schedule for completion of corrective actions, to document what
actions are to be taken, and to document the completion of those actions as they occur.

(e)(5) Addressing PHA team's findings and recommendations

Paragraph (e) of the standard requires that a team with expertise in engineering and process
operations conduct a process hazard analysis, containing specific findings and
recommendations for each covered process. The employer is then required to promptly
"address" and "resolve[]" the team's findings, document the actions taken, and communicate
these actions to the affected employees. 29 C.F.R. 1910.119(e)(5).

OSHA considers an employer to have "resolved" the team's findings and recommendations
when the employer either has adopted the recommendations, or has justifiably declined to do
so. Where a recommendation is rejected, the employer

*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 106

[Replacement page B-22]

must communicate this to the team, and expeditiously resolve any subsequent
recommendations of the team.

An employer can justifiably decline to adopt a recommendation where the employer can
document, in writing and based upon adequate evidence, that one or more of the following
conditions is true:

1.  The analysis upon which the recommendation is based contains material factual errors;

2.  The recommendation is not necessary to protect the health and safety of the employer's
own employees, or the employees of contractors;

3.  An alternative measure would provide a sufficient level of protection; or

4.  The recommendation is infeasible.

(e)(7) Retention

How long must the process hazard analyses, updates, and revalidations be retained?
For the life of the process.

 (f) Operating procedures

(f)(1) Written operating procedures

Many employers have computerized process control systems and safety interlock systems
software. Can simplified loop diagrams or narrative descriptions be used to describe the
logic of software and the relationship between the equipment and computerized process
control systems, to meet the requirements for written operating procedures at
1910.119(f)(1)? Can system logic flow charts or narrative descriptions of the computerized
safety interlock systems be used to meet these same requirements?

It is anticipated that employers would include loop diagrams, flow charts, and narrative
descriptions of control and interlock systems in their compilations of written process safety
information required by 1910.119(d) before

[Replacement page B-23]

conducting any PHAs required by 1910.119(e). Written operating procedures must be
developed to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each
covered process, consistent with the process safety information and with the associated PHA.
Simplified diagrams, flow charts, and narratives could be used in conjunction with
instructions to meet the requirements for written operating procedures at 1910.119(f)(1).

(f)(1)(iii)(c) "Control measures to be taken if physical contact or airborne exposure occurs"

Does this mean first aid, or industrial hygiene services?
It primarily means first aid procedures or emergency medical attention, which should be
consistent with the information on the {material safety data sheet MSDS/SDS.}

(g) Training
(g)(1)(i) Initial training

Training in an overview of the process, and in safety and health hazards, emergency
operations, and safe work practices, must have been completed by May 26, 1992. In
situations where operating procedures were already in place, training in those existing
procedures was required by May 26, 1992. Initial training shall have been provided by that
date, based on existing procedures and available process information. As new information
and procedures are developed, refresher training must be provided in accordance with
paragraph (g)(2).

(g)(1)(ii) Initial training--"grandfathering"

What is required in the employer's written certification regarding employees whose initial
training is "grandfathered"?
Where employees involved in operating the process have not received the initial training
required under (g)(1)(i), but have been involved in operating the process safely for a period
of time prior to May 26, 1992, the employer may waive the initial training requirement by
certifying in writing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 108

[Replacement page B-24]

that the employee has the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the
duties and responsibilities as specified in the operating procedures, written or otherwise.
Such certification may be based on on-the-job evaluation or other equivalent determination
methods. When new operating procedures--which must be written--are subsequently
developed, the employer must give training to operating employees prior to their
implementation.

(g)(2) Refresher training

Employees have to be given refresher training at least every 3 years--measured from when?
The time period for refresher training of an employee involved in operating a process is to be
measured from the date of the employee's last training [or "grandfathering," as allowed at
(g)(1)(ii)] in the overview and current operating procedures of the process.

Under what circumstances must refresher training be provided more often than every 3
years?
Employers, in consultation with employees, shall determine the appropriate frequency, which
may be based on consideration of such factors as deviations from standard operating
procedures, recent incidents, or apparent deficiencies in training.

Is training under "management of change" considered to be refresher training?
No. It is an independent training requirement, in addition to other training requirements of
the standard.

(g)(3) Training documentation

This paragraph requires the employer to make sure that operators "understand" the
training provided to them under this section. Is some method of testing required?
There must be some positive means taken by the employer to determine if employees have
understood their training and are capable of adhering to the current operating procedures of
the process. This could include the administration of a

[Replacement page B-25]

written test, although the standard does not require that a formal written test be used. Other
means of ascertaining comprehension of the training, such as on-the-job demonstrations, etc.,
are acceptable, as long as they are adequately documented.

(h) Contractors
(h) Scope of activities

The list of covered and exempted activities in paragraph (h) is meant to be illustrative of
potential contractor activities. The standard covers all contractor activities that have the
potential for affecting process safety. Therefore, paragraph (h) applies to all contractor
activities on or adjacent to a covered process, except those incidental activities that do not
influence process safety, such as janitorial work, food and drink services, laundry, delivery or
other supply services. Consequently, contractors performing construction, demolition,
equipment installation and other work that bay affect the safety of a covered process must
comply with the requirements of this paragraph. Furthermore, paragraph (h) is not the only
part of the process safety management standard that applies to contractors. In appropriate
circumstances, other provisions of the standard apply.

(h) Scope of activities--construction work

Do contractors performing construction work at a site covered by the PSM standard also
have to comply with 29 CFR 1926 standards?

Contractors performing construction work at a site covered by the PSM standard must
comply with all applicable standards under 29 CFR 1926, including Part 1926, Subpart C
requirements. See the regulation at 29 CFR 1910.12(b), which defines the term "construction
work," and the regulation at 29 CFR 1926.13, which discusses the terms "construction,"
"alteration," and "repair."

[Replacement page B-26]

(h)(1) and (2) Contractors and subcontractors
Paragraph (h) applies to all subcontractors whose work falls within the scope of covered
work as established in (h)(1). The host employer and the general contractors are both
responsible for ensuring that the duties contained in (h)(2) are performed; this applies to
inquiring into the safety records of their subcontractors, informing the subcontractor as to the
known potential hazards, the emergency action plan, and safe work practices, and ensuring
the subcontractor's compliance with the standard. Furthermore, under (h)(2)(v), the host
employer has the obligation to assure that the contract employer and the subcontractor are
properly performing their obligations under (h)(2) with respect to their subcontractors'
compliance with the standard.

The intention is that host employers and contractors exercise responsible oversight of their
respective contractors' and subcontractors' performance of safety and health requirements
under the standard.

(h)(2) Contractors--Employer responsibilities--Training

How much of the burden of training contractor employees is placed on the employer?
The burden of training contractor employees is on the contractor employer. However, under
1910.119(h)(2)(v), the host employer shall periodically evaluate the contract employer's
performance with respect to the (contract) employee instruction and training requirements at
1910.119(h)(3).

NOTE: The employer must inform a contract employer of the hazards related to the
contractor's work and the process [as noted at 1910.119(h)(2)(ii) and (iii)].

Although the standard places the primary responsibility for providing training to its
employees on the contract employer itself, the host employer bears the responsibility to
"periodically evaluate the performance of contract employers in fulfilling their obligations as
specified in paragraph (h)(3)." 29 C.F.R. 1910.119(h)(2)(v). Such "obligations" clearly
include training obligations. The standard also requires the host employer to select a contract
employer only after evaluating its safety performance and programs

[(h)(2)(i)], and to inform the contract employer about the specific hazards associated with the
process [(h)(2)(ii)] and the provisions of the emergency action plan [(h)(2)(iii)].

If contract employees are involved in operating a process or maintaining the on-going
integrity of process equipment, then they must receive training in accordance with the
specific training requirements set forth in paragraphs (g) and (j), respectively. In order to
satisfy its obligations under (h)(2)(v), the host employer must ensure, through periodic
evaluations, that the training provided to these contract employees by the contract employer
is in fact equivalent to the training that the standard requires for direct hire employees. Such
training need not be identical in format or content or context to training given to the host's
employees. The critical element is that information required by the standard must be
conveyed to and learned by contract employees as well as direct hire employees. The
obligation may be satisfied by joint training or by separate training.

Moreover, (h) requires that every employee of a covered contractor be trained in the work
practices necessary to perform safely his or her job. The contract employee must be able to
perform his or her own job tasks safely and should receive:

(a) training prior to beginning work on or near a covered process, which should encompass
(i) instruction regarding known process hazards related to his or her job, including training in
the applicable provisions of the emergency action plan; and (ii) training in the safe work
practices adopted by the host employer and the contract employer; and

(b) additional training as necessary (i) to prepare the employee for changes in the operations
or work practices at the facility and (ii) to ensure that the employee's understanding of the
applicable safe work practices and other rules remains current.

(h)(2)(i) Contractors--Employer responsibilities--Selecting a contractor

When selecting a contractor, an employer has to evaluate the potential contractor's safety
performance and programs. Must the employer document this? If so, to what extent?
The standard does not require the employer to document the evaluation of the information
obtained regarding contractor safety performance and programs. However, OSHA
compliance officers are directed to review records about these aspects of the selection
process and to determine if the employer has met the intent of this provision. (See Appendix
A of this instruction, page A-25.)

(h)(2)(vi) Contractors--Employer responsibilities--Contractor injury and illness log

What type of injury and illness log does an employer have to maintain regarding contract
employees?
If the contract employer is willing to share the OSHA 200 log and OSHA 101 first reports of
injury (or equivalent) with the employer, and if those logs and reports specifically indicate
which injuries and illnesses are related to process areas, then such records would be
acceptable to OSHA. Acceptable alternatives would be for the employer to develop a
contract employee injury and illness log separately for each contractor, or a combined log for
all contractors if the combined log distinguishes among contractors.

(i) Pre-startup safety review

(i)(2)(i) Pre-startup safety review--equipment in accordance with design specifications
The employer is responsible for ensuring that process equipment meets design specifications
prior to startup. For equipment that has been modified to the extent that a change to the
process safety information is required, the employer must ensure that the process safety
information has been modified prior to startup. (Note also the requirements of

1910.119(j)(4)(ii)--Mechanical integrity--Inspection and testing.

(j) Mechanical integrity

(j)(1)(i) Application

"Pressure vessels and storage tanks" includes "pressurized" storage tanks; i.e., tanks
designed to be used above atmospheric pressure, as well as non-pressurized (atmospheric)
storage tanks.

(j)(2) Written Procedures

The purpose of this provision is to require written procedures in adequate detail to ensure that
the specific process equipment receives careful, appropriate, regularly scheduled
maintenance to ensure its continued safe operation. A "breakdown" maintenance program
(i.e., a program wherein action is taken only when something breaks down) does not meet the
requirements of this paragraph.

(j)(2) Written Procedures

Do these written procedures need to be specific to each vessel, each type of vessel, or each
group of equipment types listed?

The procedures need to be specific to the type of vessel or equipment. Identical or very
similar vessels and items of equipment in similar service need not have individualized
maintenance procedures. Each procedure must clearly identify the equipment to which it
applies.

(j)(3) Training for process maintenance activities

As OSHA indicated in the preamble, paragraph (j)(3) requires that employers provide
maintenance employees with "on-going" or "continual" training adequate "to assure that they
can perform their jobs in a safe manner." (See 57 Fed. Reg. 6390/1.) In this regard, the
paragraph clearly contemplates that new maintenance employees be trained before beginning
work at the site, and all maintenance employees receive

NOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 114

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Replacement page B-30]

additional training appropriate to their constantly changing job tasks.

Moreover, although "maintenance employees need not be trained in process operating
procedures to the same extent as those employees who are actually involved in operating the
process" (57 Fed. Reg. 6390/1), they must be trained in all "procedures applicable to the
employee's job tasks to assure that the employee can perform the job tasks in a safe manner."
29 C.F.R. 1910.119(j)(3). Thus, a maintenance worker sent to work on a process breakdown
must be trained in operating procedures that are relevant to the repair or installation on which
he or she is working.

Finally, OSHA intends that employers incorporate all safety-related topics applicable to
maintenance tasks into the ongoing training program required by paragraph (j) to assure that
maintenance employees can perform their job tasks in a safe manner. Thus, in order to train
maintenance workers in "procedures applicable" to their job tasks under paragraph an
employer must, in appropriate circumstances, train these workers in the safe work practices
required under paragraph (f)(4), in the written procedures to manage change under paragraph
(l), and in the appropriate provisions of the emergency action plan under paragraph (n) of the
standard. These provisions, in turn, may implicate other OSHA general industry
requirements, such as, for instance, the training requirements of the lockout/tagout standard.
(See 29 C.F.R. 1910.147(c)(7).

(j)(5) Equipment deficiencies

If equipment is found to be operating outside acceptable limits, must the process be shut
down and the equipment deficiencies corrected before further use?

To ensure the ongoing mechanical integrity of the covered process, equipment deficiencies
must be corrected promptly if the equipment is outside the acceptable limits specified in the
process safety information. There may be situations where it may not be necessary that the
deficiencies be corrected "before further use" as long as the deficiencies are corrected in a
safe and timely manner when necessary means (e.g., protective measures and continuous
monitoring) are taken to ensure safe operation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 115

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Replacement page B-31]

NOTE: Operating equipment outside acceptable limits is considered to be a deficiency.

(j)(6)(ii) Quality assurance

If an installation is being done by contractors, does this require the employer to implement
a quality assurance program to monitor the activities of these contractors?
The employer is responsible for ensuring that equipment is installed consistent with design
specifications and manufacturer's instructions. This may require the employer to be involved
in the review, inspection, certification, and quality assurance of work performed by
contractors.

(l) Management of change

(1) Management of change

What does "change" encompass?
Any change whatsoever that may affect a covered process triggers the management of
change provisions. The only exception to this is when there is a replacement in kind.

Do the management of change procedures apply to items such as gaskets?
Replacements in kind are not covered. If a new gasket is to be installed that is of different
material, composition, shape, size, or design, then a management of change would be
required.

(m) Incident investigation

(m)(5) Addressing team's findings

Paragraph (m) requires that a team of knowledgeable individuals investigate every
catastrophic incident and "near-miss," and likewise requires that the employer

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 116

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Replacement page B-32]

promptly "address and resolve" the team's recommendations and document corrective action.
[See 1910.119(m)(5).]

As with the similar provision in paragraph (e), this provision was designed to require the
employer to respond to the team's findings and recommendations, while at the same time
allowing the employer the flexibility not only to reject proposals that are erroneous or
infeasible, but also to modify a recommendation that may not be as protective as possible or
may be no more protective than a less complex or expensive measure. (See 57 Fed. Reg.
6395/3.)

OSHA considers an employer to have "resolved" the team's findings and recommendations
when the employer either has adopted the recommendations, or has justifiably declined to do
so. Where a recommendation is rejected, the employer must communicate this to the team,
and expeditiously resolve any subsequent recommendations of the team.

An employer can justifiably decline to adopt a recommendation where the employer can
document, in writing and based upon adequate evidence, that one or more of the following
conditions is true:

1.  The analysis upon which the recommendation is based contains material factual errors;

2.  The recommendation is not necessary to protect the health and safety of the employer's
own employees, or the employees of contractors;

3.  An alternative measure would provide a sufficient level of protection; or

4.  The recommendation is infeasible.

(0) Compliance audits

(o)(1) Compliance audits--required frequency?
Employers must certify at least every 3 years that they have evaluated compliance with
1910.119. Under 1910.119(0)(1), employers must conduct compliance audits in a timely
manner to meet this certification requirement. The first certification is required no later than
May 26, 1995. When

[Replacement page B-33]

employers conduct compliance audits and certify compliance with 1910.119 before May 26,
1995, the subsequent certification must be within 3 years from the certification date.

NOTE: It may be necessary for employers to conduct compliance audits and certify that they
have evaluated compliance more frequently than every 3 years, because of significant or
numerous deficiencies disclosed by the previous audit, or for other reasons.

(o)(4) Documenting actions based on compliance audit findings
The purpose of this paragraph is to ensure that employers determine an appropriate response
to each of the report findings and, if employers identify a deficiency that needs to be
corrected, that they document the correction of the deficiency. The appropriate response to
each of the report findings must be promptly documented. The correction of any identified
deficiency must be documented as soon as possible after the corrective action is taken.

SAMPLE LETTER TO BE PROVIDED TO EMPLOYER FOLLOWING
SCREENING FOR PSM COVERAGE

Dear Employer:

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) evaluation of your workplace and
the information you have provided indicate that your establishment is covered by OSHA's
standard for Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119.

As you may know, the requirements of this standard are intended to protect employees by
preventing or minimizing the consequences of accidents involving highly hazardous chemicals.
OSHA believes that compliance with the standard is important for ensuring worker protection.

Accompanying this letter are copies of the following publications:

(1) "Process Safety Management," OSHA 3132, which provides information on the standard and
its requirements, and

(2) "Process Safety Management--Guidelines for Compliance," OSHA 3133.

These guidelines are not a substitute for the standard itself, which is reprinted in the "Process
Safety Management" booklet.

Your workplace will be included in an overall listing of all establishments known to be covered
by the standard. OSAH may schedule an inspection of your establishment in the future to
evaluate your compliance with the standard.

This standard is relatively new, and OSHA realizes that affected employers may have many
questions. After reading the materials provided, please feel free to direct any questions to [Area
Office; telephone number].

Sincerely,

Area Director

Appendix G

Recommended Guidelines for PQV Inspection Preparation
(Nonmandatory)

The following guidelines are suggested as background and preparation for a PQV inspection. These
are suggested actions only, and shall in no case take precedence over the guidance presented
elsewhere in this instruction.

AREA OFFICE COORDINATION

Coordination within the Area Office is absolutely essential in the orderly conduct of a PQV
inspection. The Area Director and all those involved in a PQV inspection must commit the resources
with the understanding that the project is long-term, possibly several weeks or months. It is
imperative that team members complete all outstanding assignments prior to the PQV inspection.
Equally important, team participants should not be directed or "asked" to do assignments while they
are engaged in the PQV inspection. An obvious exception would be court hearings, over which the
Area Office has little control.

The Area Director should designate a contact person in the Area Office to coordinate and oversee all
aspects of the inspection. The contact person should be a supervisor, safety or industrial hygiene
(IH), who is familiar with the PQV concept. In addition to providing Area Office coordination, the
contact person would review the entire case file/report. The team leader would communicate at least
weekly with the contact supervisor, who would then brief the Area Director as appropriate.

INSPECTION TEAM COMPOSITION

By design, a PQV inspection is a large and complex undertaking, to be accomplished by a select,
well-trained team. All members of the team must be experienced journey or senior level compliance
officers who are familiar with the chemical industry and have taken the appropriate OSHA training.
Newer compliance officers can be utilized in the inspections, but not as a substitute for regular team
members.

The team should consist of two safety compliance officers/engineers, two industrial hygiene
compliance officers, an administrative support person and a construction specialist. The team leader
could be from either discipline in the team, but preferably a safety specialist, due to the fact that most
of the critical PSM and construction related hazards reside in the area of safety.

The team leader should be a GS-12 Senior Compliance Officer with experience in large team
inspections. He or she should have excellent organizational and communication skills, both oral and
written. It would also be of benefit that the team leader be knowledgeable in word processing and
data base management computer operations. Since the team leader will be the focal point during the
conduct of the inspection, that person should also have demonstrated leadership abilities. The entire
team, the company, employees/unions and other OSHA personnel will look to the team leader for
direction and answers to the many questions that will arise during the course of the inspection.

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 126

* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT *
NOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.

[Replacement page G-2]

The team leader is responsible for the overall conduct of the inspection including planning, onsite
activities and report preparation. The leader would assign the various inspection areas to team
members in accordance with their expertise and abilities, and determine what, if any, special
expertise is needed. Additional responsibilities include:

1.  Keeping the Area Office contact apprised of activities;
2.  Providing and tracking requests for documents;
3.  Resolving problems with the company;
4.  Ensuring that the report addresses all questions in the directive.

An administrative support person would greatly increase the overall efficiency of the inspection. This
position would be ideal for an accommodated compliance officer with some computer skills and
organizational abilities. The support person would answer directly to the team leader and would be
responsible for organizing, labeling and filing the many documents that will become part of the case
file. An accommodated CSHO could also review the documents and document requests to assure the
request was properly fulfilled. In addition, an accommodated CSHO could assist the inspecting team
members with the many interviews that will be conducted. The support person would also be
responsible for the inspection supplies and equipment.

Safety and IH team members are responsible for carrying out the PQV inspection activities under the
direction of the team leader. They must keep the team leader apprised of their activities and potential
problems when they arise. The construction specialist would work for the most part independently of
the rest of the team, under the general direction of the team leader. Some crossover of inspection
areas is to be expected, as many of the contractors and company responsibilities overlap.

PRE-INSPECTION PREPARATION

Effective planning and preparation is essential to the efficient implementation and successful
completion of any large inspection, especially a PQV. Exhibit 1 provides an outline that can be used
as a guide to plan and prepare for a PQV inspection. Establishment histories can be obtained and
reviewed well in advance of the target date for the inspection. The inspection strategy and scheduling
should be done after the team has been selected. A pre-inspection meeting with all members and the
Area Office contact person should be held prior to entry.

The case file begins in the planning and preparation stage. Any documents received, such as micro to
host reports, citations and PSM-related findings (including PetroSEP) in other regions must be
logged and identified to allow for easy retrieval. An activity log/diary should be started to record all
pertinent actions taken. A computer data base management program is recommended to keep track of
the document requests and to provide a ready index of the documents that have been obtained. With
this type of system it would be easy to search for pertinent documents by using the OSHA
identification number, topic of document, company identification number, date of request, etc., and
to ensure that various members of the team do not duplicate requests for documents.

The team should develop a weekly schedule of activities, taking into account travel days, holidays,
start time, stop time, company briefings and internal briefings. Time should be allotted during the
inspection week to complete necessary paperwork and documentation and tie up loose ends.

[Page G-3]

DOCUMENTS

PQV inspections will require compliance officers to review numerous company documents. Many of these documents will become part of the case file as documentation for potential citations or for documentation of the required PSM elements. It is imperative that these documents be organized and identified so that they may be readily referenced and reviewed. It is highly recommended that all requests for copies of company documents be in writing. A standard document request format should be established and should contain at least the following information:
1. Who is the requester
2. To whom the request is made
3. Identity of the document (in company terms if possible)
4. Company document number
5. Date of request
6. Priority for response
7. Internal I.D. number or docket number (for filing)
8. Date request fulfilled
9. Comment section (did the response fulfill request).

It should be noted that there is no universal language used to identify documents. Different companies have different names for the same type of document. It is therefore essential to clearly communicate what information is needed and desired prior to writing the request. The document requests should be in duplicate: one copy for the company and the other to be retained in the case file. To avoid long discussions and legal department involvement, all documents obtained should be considered proprietary information.

Prior to the documents actually being received, a filing system should be developed. The system should be secure, accessible to all team members and ensure that individual documents are easily retrievable. The administrative support person could manage the filing system to ensure its continued effectiveness. NOTE: Only appropriate documents should be maintained in the filing system; field notes, document "clips", and document review/evaluation notes should remain with the corresponding 1B's.

Exhibit 2 contains a list of those documents most commonly requested. It is divided into two sections: Pre-Unit Selection and Unit-Specific Documents.

INSPECTION FACILITIES

The PQV team needs a suitable work area/command center from which the inspection can be conducted and coordinated. Except in the most unusual of circumstances, the company will provide the requisite onsite space. Almost any room will suffice, providing it meets some basic requirements. The work area must be secure 24 hours a day with access limited to the inspection team and those company officials who would respond in an emergency. This is important so as to preclude taking boxes of documents and equipment in and out each day. The room should have sufficient desks and/or tables for reviewing documents and writing the report. Provisions should be made for communications--one phone line as a minimum. Outgoing calls should be charged on the Area Office calling card. Where phone service is not provided, the team should have a portable cellular phone.

[Page G-4]

Sufficient power outlets should be available for charging pumps, batteries and other inspection
equipment.

The inspection team will need copies of a number of documents. It is hoped that the company would
provide copying services or the use of a copy machine. The administrative support person could
make the copies should the company not provide these services.

The team leader must determine as soon as possible, what--if any--of the necessary facilities the
company will provide. If the company does not provide all of the necessary facilities voluntarily, or
puts disruptive restrictions on their use, the ARA for Technical Support should be contacted as soon
as possible so that alternate facilities can be arranged. This may result in the use of a rented copier(s)
and office space.

INSPECTION EQUIPMENT

Upon entry to the site, the inspection team should be fully prepared with all necessary inspection
equipment and personal protective equipment. Exhibit 3 contains a list of equipment that may be
useful to prepare for the inspection. In addition, an inspection "kit" is outlined which can be used to
set up the command center. Some of the items in the "kit" may appear to be trivial; however, all of
these items will be needed at some time during the inspection. It may not be practical to go back and
forth to the office or a store to get these items, particularly if the inspection site is in a remote
location. The administrative support person would be responsible for maintaining adequate supplies
throughout the inspection.

CRITICAL INSPECTION AREAS

It is essential that team members have specific subjects and areas to investigate. The team leader,
with input from the team members, should assign the inspection areas prior to entry. This will help to
avoid confusion and duplication of effort. In addition, the team members will be able to be better
prepared for their individual tasks.

As inspection subjects are completed, the information should be reviewed with the team leader
before going on to the next assignment. The state of compliance or noncompliance within any given
area may require the team leader to modify the assignment list so as to make the most of the
resources available.

CONTRACTORS

Contractors are an integral part of any PSM inspection. There may be only a few contractors or
dozens, with several hundred contract employees, depending on whether the facility is undergoing a
shutdown or turnaround.

It is imperative that, upon entry, the scope of the contractor activity be determined. The construction
specialist on the team will have to formulate an inspection plan and set appropriate priorities. It is not
the intent of the PQV inspection to inspect all outside contractors that are on-site, rather to inspect
only those contractors who may be exposed to, or could cause or be affected by a catastrophic
incident. Food service workers, certain janitorial employees and similar activities would

[Page G-5]

not normally be inspected. Remote construction projects not associated with catastrophic potential
would not necessarily be inspected.

The term "contractor" is not limited to construction type activities. Many chemical facilities use
contract maintenance workers, vessel and piping inspectors, vessel heat treating, cleaning,
engineering and similar non-construction contractors who remain at the facility year round or are
called in at regular intervals. They are used to supplement existing plant personnel for regular duties
and for special projects.

A shared responsibility for both contractors and company is quality assurance. It is essential that all
materials and workmanship meet engineering standards. There should be sufficient checks to ensure
that materials, such as the proper alloy or carbon steel pipe is used, and that the studs and/or bolts are
of the proper size and grade. This is especially important in contractor supplied materials.

CRITICAL EXPERTISE

Situations may arise in a PQV inspection that are beyond the technical expertise of the team
members. A list should be developed identifying OSHA personnel and/or private sector experts and
how they may be contacted. Areas where this expertise may be needed are:
1. Pressure equipment
2. Fire protection (fire brigades)
3. Facility siting
4. Emergency medical services
5. Hazardous waste operations
6. Dispersion modeling & incident command centers
7. Process hazard analysis/HAZOPS
8. Process chemistry
9. Industry practice

By no means is this list all-inclusive. It should be modified as needed to reflect current technology
and hazards.

DOCUMENTATION

In order to withstand the probable legal challenges, all items must be thoroughly documented. Since
the team will be made up of journey-and senior-level CSHOs, good documentation is to be expected.
All OSHA-1B forms must be complete and legible. Shortcuts for employer knowledge such as
"should have known" or "reasonable diligence" are not acceptable. Appropriate company documents,
logs, procedures, permits, etc., should be referenced on the 1B for the particular violation.

Photographic documentation, either still camera or videotape, should be reviewed as soon as
practicable to ensure that the condition or violation is appropriately depicted. Retake any photos or
videos that are not good quality.

CASE FILE AND REPORT PREPARATION

[Page G-6]

A PQV inspection will take weeks or months of onsite activity and will generate a large amount
of paper, both in field notes and documents. It is essential that the paper flow be organized and
well maintained. This will result not only in a more efficient onsite survey, but will greatly
reduce the write-up time.

A daily log, either manual or computer generated, should be maintained indicating the team
members onsite, daily activities, meetings, problems, or other details, as necessary. All OSHA-
1B forms should be completed as the violation is observed, documenting the employees exposed,
the date, time, location and management representative who accompanied the CSHO. Each
instance of a violation should have a separate 1B. Where multiple violations are noted on a form,
the form should be photocopied and highlighted showing the appropriate instance and
corresponding documentation. Alleged violation descriptions should be written as soon as
practicable, while the hazard is fresh in the mind of the CSHO. Multi-employer policy citations
must be coordinated with respect to exposing, controlling, correcting and creating employers'
files.

Case file structure and organization must begin prior to entry into the facility. All documents
must be logged and an index (computer preferred) generated, indicating the subject matter,
document identification number, file number and the location of the document (box number).
This is essential, as these documents may have to be referenced or retrieved many times during
the course of the inspection and the review process. A data base management program for the
PC's would be extremely beneficial. Computer disks should be backed up daily, or more often as
necessary. The photos and videotape taken during the inspection should be properly identified
with photographer, date, roll or tape number and subject. They should be kept in a separate file.

Appendix H

Recording PSM-Related Inspection in IMIS

Information about PSM-related inspection activity, as described at H. of this instruction, shall be recorded in IMIS following current instructions in the IMIS manual. These guidelines shall apply:

1.  **PQV Inspections.** The identifier code "PSMPQV" shall be used for these inspections.
    a. PQV inspections, as described at J., K., and L. of this instruction, shall be identified by recording "PSMPQV" in item 25.d of the OSHA-1 Form.
    b. Any inspections of onsite contractors shall also be identified by recording "PSMPQV" in item 25.d of the OSHA-1 Form.
    c. Linkage of all of the employers inspected on-site shall be performed in accordance with the instructions for entering **Multi-Employer Inspections** currently specified in Chapter V, item E.(5.), of the IMIS Forms Manual.
    d. PQV inspections may be programmed or unprogrammed; all PQV inspections shall be identified as comprehensive.

2.  **Unprogrammed PSM-related Inspections.** All unprogrammed inspection activity relating to the PSM standard--as described at H.3. of this instruction--shall be coded as follows in Item 42, Optional Information of the OSHA-1 form:


| TYPE | ID | VALUE |
|---|---|---|
| N | 06 | PSMP |


This shall apply to all unprogrammed inspections in which compliance with the PSM standard is investigated; i.e., inspections in which the establishment:

a. Is not in one of the SIC codes listed in Appendix C of this instruction; or

b. Is not an establishment selected for a PQV inspection, although it is in one of the SIC codes listed in Appendix C of this instruction.
