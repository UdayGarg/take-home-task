Subpart HH-National Emission
Standards for Hazardous Air
Pollutants From Oil and Nat-
ural Gas Production Facilities

SOURCE: 64 FR 32628, June 17, 1999, unless
otherwise noted.

$63.760 Applicability and designation
of affected source.

(a) This subpart applies to the owners
and operators of the emission points,
specified in paragraph (b) of this sec-
tion that are located at oil and natural
gas production facilities that meet the
specified criteria in paragraphs (a)(1)
and either (a) (2) or (a) (3) of this sec-
tion.

(1) Facilities that are major or area
sources of hazardous air pollutants
(HAP) as defined in Â§63.761. Emissions
for major source determination pur-
poses can be estimated using the max-
imum natural gas or hydrocarbon liq-
uid throughput, as appropriate, cal-
culated in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through
(iii) of this section. As an alternative
to calculating the maximum natural
gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput,
the owner or operator of a new or exist-
ing source may use the facility's design
maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon
liquid throughput to estimate the max-
imum potential emissions. Other
means to determine the facility's
major source status are allowed, pro-
vided the information is documented
and recorded to the Administrator's
satisfaction in accordance with
Â§63.10(b)(3). A facility that is deter-
mined to be an area source, but subse-
quently increases its emissions or its
potential to emit above the major
source levels, and becomes a major
source, must comply thereafter with
all provisions of this subpart applicable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to a major source starting on the appli-
cable compliance date specified in
paragraph (f) of this section. Nothing
in this paragraph is intended to pre-
clude a source from limiting its poten-
tial to emit through other appropriate
mechanisms that may be available
through the permitting authority.

(i) If the owner or operator docu-
ments, to the Administrator's satisfac-
tion, a decline in annual natural gas or
hydrocarbon liquid throughput, as ap-
propriate, each year for the 5 years
prior to October 15, 2012, the owner or
operator shall calculate the maximum
natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid
throughput used to determine max-
imum potential emissions according to
the requirements specified in para-
graph (a)(1)(1)(A) of this section. In all
other circumstances, the owner or op-
erator shall calculate the maximum
throughput used to determine whether
a facility is a major source in accord-
ance with the requirements specified in
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

(A) The maximum natural gas or hy-
drocarbon liquid throughput is the av-
erage of the annual natural gas or hy-
drocarbon liquid throughput for the 3
years prior to October 15, 2012, multi-
plied by a factor of 1.2.

(B) The maximum natural gas or hy-
drocarbon liquid throughput is the
highest annual natural gas or hydro-
carbon liquid throughput over the 5
years prior to October 15, 2012, multi-
plied by a factor of 1.2.

(ii) The owner or operator shall
maintain records of the annual facility
natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid
throughput each year and upon request
submit such records to the Adminis-
trator. If the facility annual natural
gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput
increases above the maximum natural
gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput
calculated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or
(a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the max-
imum natural gas or hydrocarbon liq-
uid throughput must be recalculated
using the higher throughput multiplied
by a factor of 1.2.

(iii) The owner or operator shall de-
termine the maximum values for other
parameters used to calculate emissions
as the maximum for the period over
which the maximum natural gas or hy
drocarbon liquid throughput is deter-

240

40 CFR Ch. I (7-1-15 Edition)

mined in accordance with paragraph
(a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. Pa-
rameters, other than glycol circulation
rate, shall be based on either highest
measured values or annual average.
For estimating maximum potential
emissions from glycol dehydration
units, the glycol circulation rate used
in the calculation shall be the unit's
maximum rate under its physical and
operational design consistent with the
definition of potential to emit in Â§ 63.2.

(2) Facilities that process, upgrade,
or store hydrocarbon liquids.

(3) Facilities that process, upgrade,
or store natural gas prior to the point
at which natural gas enters the natural
gas transmission and storage source
category or is delivered to a final end
user. For the purposes of this subpart,
natural gas enters the natural gas
transmission and storage source cat-
egory after the natural gas processing
plant, when present. If no natural gas
processing plant is present, natural gas
enters the natural gas transmission
and storage source category after the
point of custody transfer.

(b) The affected sources for major
sources are listed in paragraph (b)(1) of
this section and for area sources in
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(1) For major sources, the affected
source shall comprise each emission
point located at a facility that meets
the criteria specified in paragraph (a)
of this section and listed in paragraphs
(b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this sec-
tion.

(i) Each glycol dehydration unit as
specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A)
through (C) of this section.

(A) Each large glycol dehydration
unit;

(B) Each small glycol dehydration
unit for which construction com-
menced on or before August 23, 2011, is
an existing small glycol dehydration
unit; and

(C) Each small glycol dehydration
unit for which construction com-
menced after August 23, 2011, is a new
small glycol dehydration unit.

(ii) Each storage vessel with the po-
tential for flash emissions;

(iii) The group of all ancillary equip-
ment, except compressors, intended to
operate in volatile hazardous air pol-
lutant service (as defined in Â§63.761),


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

which are located at natural gas proc- essing plants; and

(iv) Compressors intended to operate in volatile hazardous air pollutant service (as defined in Â§63.761), which are located at natural gas processing plants.

(2) For area sources, the affected source includes each triethylene glycol (TEG) dehydration unit located at a fa- cility that meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Any source that determines it is not a major source but has actual emissions of 5 tons per year or more of a single HAP, or 12.5 tons per year or more of a combination of HAP (i.Ðµ., 50 percent of the major source thresh- olds), shall update its major source de- termination within 1 year of the prior determination or October 15, 2012, whichever is later, and each year there- after, using gas composition data measured during the preceding 12 months.

(d) The owner and operator of a facil- ity that does not contain an affected source as specified in paragraph (b) of this section are not subject to the re- quirements of this subpart.

(e) Exemptions. The facilities listed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e) (2) of this sec- tion are exempt from the requirements of this subpart. Records shall be main- tained as required in Â§ 63.10(b)(3).

(1) A facility that exclusively proc- esses, stores, or transfers black oil (as defined in Â§ 63.761) is not subject to the requirements of this subpart. For the purposes of this subpart, a black oil fa- cility that uses natural gas for fuel or generates gas from black oil shall qual- ify for this exemption.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 6

Â§ 63.761

*Equipment leaks* means emissions of HAP from ancillary equipment (as defined in this section) and compressors.

*Facility* means any grouping of equipment where hydrocarbon liquids are processed, upgraded (i.e., remove impurities or other constituents to meet contract specifications), or stored prior to the point of custody transfer; or where natural gas is processed, upgraded, or stored prior to entering the natural gas transmission and storage source category. For the purpose of a major source determination, *facility* (including a building, structure, or installation) means oil and natural gas production and processing equipment that is located within the boundaries of an individual surface site as defined in this section. Equipment that is part of a facility will typically be located within close proximity to other equipment located at the same facility. Pieces of production equipment or groupings of equipment located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether or not connected by a road, waterway, power line or pipeline, shall not be considered part of the same facility. Examples of facilities in the oil and natural gas production source category include, but are not limited to, well sites, satellite tank batteries, central tank batteries, a compressor station that transports natural gas to a natural gas processing plant, and natural gas processing plants.

*Field natural gas* means natural gas extracted from a production well prior to entering the first stage of processing, such as dehydration.

*Fixed-roof* means a cover that is mounted on a storage vessel in a stationary manner and that does not move with fluctuations in liquid level.

*Flame zone* means the portion of the combustion chamber in a combustion device occupied by the flame envelope.

*Flare* means a thermal oxidation system using an open flame (i.e., without enclosure).

*Flash tank.* See the definition for gas-condensate-glycol (GCG) separator.

*Flow indicator* means a device which indicates whether gas flow is present in

244

40 CFR Ch. I (7-1-15 Edition)

a line or whether the valve position would allow gas flow to be present in a line.

*Gas-condensate-glycol (GCG) separator* means a two or three-phase separator through which the ârichâ glycol stream of a glycol dehydration unit is passed to remove entrained gas and hydrocarbon liquid. The GCG separator is commonly referred to as a flash separator or flash tank.

*Gas-to-oil ratio (GOR)* means the number of standard cubic meters of gas produced per liter of crude oil or other hydrocarbon liquid.

*Glycol dehydration unit* means a device in which a liquid glycol (including, but not limited to, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or triethylene glycol) absorbent directly contacts a natural gas stream and absorbs water in a contact tower or absorption column (absorber). The glycol contacts and absorbs water vapor and other gas stream constituents from the natural gas and becomes ârichâ glycol. This glycol is then regenerated in the glycol dehydration unit reboiler. The âleanâ glycol is then recycled.

*Glycol dehydration unit baseline operations* means operations representative of the large glycol dehydration unit operations as of June 17, 1999 and the small glycol dehydrator unit operations as of August 23, 2011. For the purposes of this subpart, for determining the percentage of overall HAP emission reduction attributable to process modifications, baseline operations shall be parameter values (including, but not limited to, glycol circulation rate or glycol-HAP absorbency) that represent actual long-term conditions (i.e., at least 1 year). Glycol dehydration units in operation for less than 1 year shall document that the parameter values represent expected long-term operating conditions had process modifications not been made.

*Glycol dehydration unit process vent* means the glycol dehydration unit reboiler vent and the vent from the GCG separator (flash tank), if present.

*Glycol dehydration unit reboiler vent* means the vent through which exhaust from the reboiler of a glycol dehydration unit passes from the reboiler to the atmosphere or to a control device.

Hazardous air pollutants or HAP
means the chemical compounds listed
in section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act.
All chemical compounds listed in sec-
tion 112(b) of the Act need to be consid-
ered when making a major source de-
termination. Only the HAP compounds
listed in Table 1 of this subpart need to
be considered when determining com-
pliance.

Hydrocarbon liquid means any natu-
rally occurring, unrefined petroleum
liquid.

In VHAP service means that a piece of
ancillary equipment or compressor ei-
ther contains or contacts a fluid (liquid
or gas) which has a total volatile HAP
(VHAP) concentration equal to or
greater than 10 percent by weight as
determined according to the provisions
of Â§ 63.772(a).

In wet gas service means that a piece
of equipment contains or contacts the
field gas before the extraction of nat-
ural gas liquids.

Incinerator means an enclosed com-
bustion device that is used for destroy-
ing organic compounds. Auxiliary fuel
may be used to heat waste gas to com-
bustion temperatures. Any energy re-
covery section is not physically formed

or connections carrying flue gas. The
above energy recovery section limita-
tion does not apply to an energy recov-
ery section used solely to preheat the
incoming vent stream or combustion
air.

ducing standard cubic meters of gas per
liter at the time that the reservoir
pressure is above the bubble point pres-
sure (or dewpoint pressure for a gas).

Initial startup means the first time a
new or reconstructed source begins
production. For the purposes of this
subpart, initial startup does not in-
clude subsequent startups (as defined
in this section) of equipment, for exam-
ple, following malfunctions or shut-
downs.

Large glycol dehydration unit means a
glycol dehydration unit with an actual
annual average natural gas flowrate
equal to or greater than 85 thousand

Â§ 63.761

standard cubic meters per day and ac-
tual annual average benzene emissions
equal to or greater than 0.90 Mg/yr, de-
termined according to Â§ 63.772(b). A gly-
col dehydration unit complying with
the 0.9 Mg/yr control option under
Â§63.765(b)(1)(ii) is considered to be a
large dehydrator.

Major source, as used in this subpart,
shall have the same meaning as in
Â§63.2, except that:

(1) Emissions from any oil or gas ex-
ploration or production well (with its
associated equipment, as defined in
this section), and emissions from any
pipeline compressor station or pump
station shall not be aggregated with
emissions from other similar units to
determine whether such emission
points or stations are major sources,
even when emission points are in a con-
tiguous area or under common control;

(2) Emissions from processes, oper-
ations, or equipment that are not part

Â§ 63.762 Affirmative defense for viola-
tions of emission standards during
malfunction.

(a) The provisions set forth in this
subpart shall apply at all times.

(b)-(c) [Reserved]

(d) In response to an action to en-
force the standards set forth in this
subpart, you may assert an affirmative
defense to a claim for civil penalties
for violations of such standards that
are caused by malfunction, as defined
in 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties
may be assessed; however, if you fail to
meet your burden of proving all of the
requirements in the affirmative de-
fense, the affirmative defense shall not
be available for claims for injunctive
relief.

(1) To establish the affirmative de-
fense in any action to enforce such a
standard, you must timely meet the re-
porting requirements in paragraph
(d)(2) of this section, and must prove by
a preponderance of evidence that:

(i) The violation:

(A) Was caused by a sudden, infre-
quent, and unavoidable failure of air
pollution control equipment, process
equipment, or a process to operate in a
normal or usual manner; and

(B) Could not have been prevented
through careful planning, proper design
or better operation and maintenance
practices; and

(C) Did not stem from any activity or
event that could have been foreseen
and avoided, or planned for; and

(D) Was not part of a recurring pat-
tern indicative of inadequate design,
operation, or maintenance; and

(ii) Repairs were made as expedi-
tiously as possible when a violation oc-
curred. Off-shift and overtime labor
were used, to the extent practicable to
make these repairs; and

(iii) The frequency, amount and dura-
tion of the violation (including any by-
pass) were minimized to the maximum
extent practicable; and

(iv) If the violation resulted from a
bypass of control equipment or a proc-
ess, then the bypass was unavoidable to
prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage; and

(v) All possible steps were taken to
minimize the impact of the violation
on ambient air quality, the environ-
ment, and human health; and

248

40 CFR Ch. I (7-1-15 Edition)

(vi) All emissions monitoring and
control systems were kept in operation
if at all possible, consistent with safety
and good air pollution control prac-
tices; and

(vii) All of the actions in response to
the violation were documented by
properly signed, contemporaneous op-
erating logs; and

(viii) At all times, the affected source
was operated in a manner consistent
with good practices for minimizing
emissions; and

(ix) A written root cause analysis has
been prepared, the purpose of which is
to determine, correct, and eliminate
the primary causes of the malfunction
and the violation resulting from the
malfunction event at issue. The anal-
ysis shall also specify, using best moni-
toring methods and engineering judg-
ment, the amount of any emissions
that were the result of the malfunc-
tion.

(2) *Report.* The owner or operator
seeking to assert an affirmative de-
fense shall submit a written report to
the Administrator with all necessary
supporting documentation, that it has
met the requirements set forth in para-
graph (d)(1) of this section. This affirm-
ative defense report shall be included
in the first periodic compliance, devi-
ation report or excess emission report
otherwise required after the initial oc-
currence of the violation of the rel-
evant standard (which may be the end
of any applicable averaging period). If
such compliance, deviation report or
excess emission report is due less than
45 days after the initial occurrence of
the violation, the affirmative defense
report may be included in the second
compliance, deviation report or excess
emission report due after the initial
occurrence of the violation of the rel-
evant standard.

is compared directly to the applicable
value for the potential leak interface
as specified in paragraph (c) (8) of this
section.

(ii) If an owner or operator chooses to
adjust the detection instrument read-
ings for the background organic con-
centration level, the value of the arith-
metic difference between the maximum
organic concentration value measured
by the instrument and the background
organic concentration value as deter-
mined in paragraph (c) (5) of this sec-
tion is compared with the applicable
value for the potential leak interface
as specified in paragraph (c) (8) of this
section.

(8) A potential leak interface is de-
termined to operate with no detectable
organic emissions if the organic con-
centration value determined in para-
graph (c)(7) of this section, is less than
500 parts per million by volume.

(d) Test procedures and compliance
demonstrations for small glycol dehydra-
tion units. This paragraph applies to
the test procedures for small dehydra-
tion units.

(1) If the owner or operator is using a
control device to comply with the
emission limit in Â§63.765(b)(1)(iii), the
requirements of paragraph (e) of this
section apply. Compliance is dem-
onstrated using the methods specified
in paragraph (f) of this section.

(2) If no control device is used to
comply with the emission limit in
Â§63.765(b)(1)(iii), the owner or operator
must determine the glycol dehydration
unit BTEX emissions as specified in
paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this
section. Compliance is demonstrated if
the BTEX emissions determined as
specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through
(iii) are less than the emission limit
calculated using the equation in
Â§63.765(b)(1)(iii).

(i) Method 1 or 1A, 40 CFR part 60, ap-
pendix A, as appropriate, shall be used
for selection of the sampling sites at
the outlet of the glycol dehydration
unit process vent. Any references to
particulate mentioned in Methods 1
and 1A do not apply to this section.

(ii) The gas volumetric flowrate shall
be determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C,
or 2D, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as
appropriate.

259

(iii) The BTEX emissions from the
outlet of the glycol dehydration unit
process vent shall be determined using
the procedures specified in paragraph
(e)(3)(v) of this section. As an alter-
native, the mass rate of BTEX at the
outlet of the glycol dehydration unit
process vent may be calculated using
the model GRI-GLYCalcTM, Version 3.0
or higher, and the procedures presented
in the associated GRI-GLYCalcTM
Technical Reference Manual. Inputs to
the model shall be representative of ac-
tual operating conditions of the glycol
dehydration unit and shall be deter-
mined using the procedures docu-
mented in the Gas Research Institute
(GRI) report entitled "Atmospheric
Rich/Lean Method for Determining
Glycol Dehydrator Emissions" (GRI-95/
0368.1). When the BTEX mass rate is
calculated for glycol dehydration units
using the model GRI-GLYCalcTÐ¼, all
BTEX measured by Method 18, 40 CFR
part 60, appendix A, shall be summed.

(e) Control device performance test pro-
cedures. This paragraph applies to the
performance testing of control devices.
The owners or operators shall dem-
onstrate that a control device achieves
the performance requirements of
Â§63.771(d)(1), (e)(3)(ii) or (f)(1) using a
performance test as specified in para-
graph (e) (3) of this section. Owners or
operators using a condenser have the
option to use a design analysis as spec-
ified in paragraph (e) (4) of this section.
The owner or operator may elect to use
the alternative procedures in para-
graph (e)(5) of this section for perform-
ance testing of a condenser used to

ethane) or total HAP at the outlet of the
control device, as calculated under para-
graph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, kilo-

(D) If the vent stream entering a
boiler or process heater with a design
capacity less than 44 megawatts is in-

the samples shall be taken at approxi-
mately equal intervals in time, such as
15-minute intervals during the run.

(B) The TOC concentration or total
HAP concentration shall be calculated
according to paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(1)
or (e)(3)(iv)(B)(2) of this section.

(1) The TOC concentration is the sum
of the concentrations of the individual
components and shall be computed for
each run using the following equation:


$C_{TOC} = \sum_{i=1}^{x} (\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n} C_{ji}}{x})$


Where:

centration. The samples shall be taken
during the same time that the samples
are taken for determining TOC con-
centration or total HAP concentration.

(2) The TOC or HAP concentration
shall be corrected for percent oxygen
by using the following equation:

lish the design outlet organic com-
pound concentration level, design aver-
age temperature of the condenser ex-
haust vent stream, and the design aver-
age temperatures of the coolant fluid
at the condenser inlet and outlet. As
an alternative to the condenser design
analysis, an owner or operator may
elect to use the procedures specified in
paragraph (e)(5) of this section.

(ii) If the owner or operator and the
Administrator do not agree on a dem-
onstration of control device perform-
ance using a design analysis then the
disagreement shall be resolved using
the results of a performance test per-
formed by the owner or operator in ac-
cordance with the requirements of
paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The
Administrator may choose to have an
authorized representative observe the
performance test.

(5) As an alternative to the proce-
dures in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this sec-
tion, an owner or operator may elect to
use the procedures documented in the
GRI report entitled, "Atmospheric
Rich/Lean Method for Determining
Glycol Dehydrator Emissions" (GRIâ95/
0368.1) as inputs for the model GRI-
GLYCalcTM, Version 3.0 or higher, to
generate a condenser performance
curve.

(f) Compliance demonstration for con-
trol device performance requirements.
This paragraph applies to the dem-
onstration of compliance with the con-
trol device performance requirements
specified in Â§63.771(d)(1)(i), (e)(3), and
(f)(1). Compliance shall be dem-
onstrated using the requirements in
paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this sec-
tion. As an alternative, an owner or op-
erator that installs a condenser as the
control device to achieve the require-
ments specified in Â§63.771(d)(1)(ii),
(e)(3), or (f)(1) may demonstrate com-
pliance according to paragraph (g) of
this section. An owner or operator may
switch between compliance with para-
graph (f) of this section and compliance
with paragraph (g) of this section only
after at least 1 year of operation in
compliance with the selected approach.
Notification of such a change in the
compliance method shall be reported in

264

40 CFR Ch. I (7â1â15 Edition)

the next Periodic Report, as required
in Â§63.775(e), following the change.

(1) The owner or operator shall estab-
lish a site specific maximum or min-
imum monitoring parameter value (as
appropriate) according to the require-
ments of Â§ 63.773(d)(5)(i).

(2) The owner or operator shall cal-
culate the daily average of the applica-
ble monitored parameter in accordance
with Â§63.773(d)(4) except that the inlet
gas flowrate to the control device shall
not be averaged.

(3) Compliance with the operating pa-
rameter limit is achieved when the
daily average of the monitoring param-
eter value calculated under paragraph
(f)(2) of this section is either equal to
or greater than the minimum or equal
to or less than the maximum moni-
toring value established under para-
graph (f)(1) of this section. For inlet
gas flowrate, compliance with the oper-
ating parameter limit is achieved when
the value is equal to or less than the
value established under Â§63.772(h) or
under the performance test conducted
under Â§ 63.772(e), as applicable.

(4) Except for periods of monitoring
system malfunctions, repairs associ-
ated with monitoring system malfunc-
tions, and required monitoring system
quality assurance or quality control
activities (including, as applicable, sys-
tem accuracy audits and required zero
and span adjustments), the CMS re-
quired in Â§ 63.773(d) must be operated at
all times the affected source is oper-
ating. A monitoring system malfunc-
tion is any sudden, infrequent, not rea-
sonably preventable failure of the mon-
itoring system to provide valid data.
Monitoring system failures that are
caused in part by poor maintenance or
careless operation are not malfunc-
tions. Monitoring system repairs are
required to be completed in response to
monitoring system malfunctions and
to return the monitoring system to op-
eration as expeditiously as practicable.

(5) Data recorded during monitoring
system malfunctions, repairs associ-
ated with monitoring system malfunc-
tions, or required monitoring system
quality assurance or control activities
may not be used in calculations used to
report emissions or operating levels.
All the data collected during all other
required data collection periods must

be used in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.

(6) Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required quality monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, system accuracy audits and required zero and span adjustments), failure to collect required data is a deviation of the monitoring requirements.

(g) Compliance demonstration with percent reduction or emission limit performance requirementsâcondensers. This paragraph applies to the demonstration of compliance with the performance requirements specified in Â§ 63.771(d)(1)(ii), (e)(3), or (f)(1) for condensers. Compliance shall be demonstrated using the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) The owner or operator shall establish a site-specific condenser performance curve according to Â§ 63.773(d)(5)(ii). For sources required to meet the ÐÐ¢ÐÐ¥ limit in accordance with Â§63.771(e) or (f)(1) the owner or operator shall identify the minimum percent reduction necessary to meet the BTEX limit.

(2) Compliance with the requirements in Â§63.771(d)(1)(ii), (e)(3), or (f)(1) shall be demonstrated by the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.

and a condenser in accordance with the requirements of Â§63.771(e), the 365-day average HAP, or BTEX, emission reduction shall be calculated using the emission reduction achieved through process modifications and the condenser efficiency as determined in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, both for the previous 365 operating days.

(A) After the compliance dates specified in Â§63.760(f), an owner or operator with less than 120 days of data for determining average ÐÐÐ , or BTEX, emission reduction, as appropriate, shall calculate the average HAP, or BTEX emission reduction, as appropriate, for the first 120 days of operation after the compliance dates. For sources required to meet the overall 95.0 percent reduction requirement, compliance is achieved if the 120-day average HAP emission reduction is equal to or greater than 90.0 percent. For sources required to meet the BTEX limit under Â§63.765(b)(1)(iii), compliance is achieved if the average ÐÐ¢ÐÐ¥ emission reduction is at least 95.0 percent of the required 365-day value identified under paragraph (g)(1) of this section (i.e., at least 76.0 percent if the 365-day design value is 80.0 percent).

(B) After 120 days and no more than 364 days of operation after the compliance dates specified in Â§63.760(f), the owner or operator shall calculate the average HAP emission reduction as the HAP emission reduction averaged over the number of days between the current day and the applicable compliance date. For sources required to meet the overall 95.0-percent reduction requirement, compliance with the performance requirements is achieved if the average HAP emission reduction is equal to or greater than 90.0 percent. For sources required to meet the BTEX limit under Â§63.765(b)(1)(iii), compliance is achieved if the average ÐÐ¢ÐÐ¥ emission reduction is at least 95.0 percent of the required 365-day value identified under paragraph (g)(1) of this section (i.e., at least 76.0 percent if the 365-day design value is 80.0 percent).

(3) If the owner or operator has data for 365 days or more of operation, compliance is achieved based on the applicable criteria in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.

curve shall be based on values meas-
ured during the performance test and
supplemented as necessary by control
device design analysis, or control de-
vice manufacturer's recommendations,
or a combination of both.

puts for the model GRI-GLYCalc ÑÐ¼,
Version 3.0 or higher, to generate a
condenser performance curve.

(6) An excursion for a given control
device is determined to have occurred
when the monitoring data or lack of
monitoring data result in any one of
the criteria specified in paragraphs
(d)(6)(i) through (vi) of this section

parameters are monitored for the same
control device and during the same op-
erating day and more than one of these
operating parameters meets an excur-
sion criterion specified in paragraphs
(d)(6)(i) through (vi) of this section,
then a single excursion is determined
to have occurred for the control device
for that operating day.

(i) An excursion occurs when the
daily average value of a monitored op-
erating parameter is less than the min-
imum operating parameter limit (or, if
applicable, greater than the maximum
operating parameter limit) established
for the operating parameter in accord-
ance with the requirements of para-
graph (d)(5)(i) of this section.

meeting Â§63.771(f)(1), an excursion oc-
curs when the 365-day average con-
denser efficiency calculated according
to the requirements specified in
Â§63.772(g)(2)(iii) is less than 95.0 percent
of the identified 365-day required per-
cent reduction.

(iii) For sources meeting
Â§63.771(d)(1)(ii), if an owner or operator
has less than 365 days of data, an excur-
sion occurs when the average con-
denser efficiency calculated according
to the procedures specified in
Â§63.772(g)(2)(iii) (A) or (B) is less than
90.0 percent. For sources meeting
Â§63.771(f)(1), an excursion occurs when
the 365-day average condenser effi-
ciency calculated according to the re-
quirements specified in Â§63.772(g)(2)(iii)
is less than the identified 365-day re-
quired percent reduction.

(iv) An excursion occurs when the
monitoring data are not available for
at least 75 percent of the operating
hours in a day.

(v) If the closed-vent system contains
one or more bypass devices that could
be used to divert all or a portion of the
gases, vapors, or fumes from entering
the control device, an excursion occurs
when:

(A) For each bypass line subject to
Â§63.771(c)(3)(1)(A) the flow indicator in-
dicates that flow has been detected and
that the stream has been diverted away
from the control device to the atmos-
phere.

(B) For each bypass line subject to
Â§63.771(c)(3)(1)(B), if the seal or closure
mechanism has been broken, the by-
pass line valve position has changed,
the key for the lock-and-key type lock
has been checked out, or the car-seal
has broken.

maximum established during the test
conducted under Â§ 63.772(h).

(B) Failure of the quarterly visible
emissions test conducted under
Â§63.772(1)(3) occurs.

(7) For each excursion, the owner or
operator shall be deemed to have failed
to have applied control in a manner
that achieves the required operating
parameter limits. Failure to achieve
the required operating parameter lim-
its is a violation of this standard.

with paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) Periodic reports must be sub-mitted on an annual basis. The first re-porting period shall cover the period beginning on the date the Notification of Compliance Status Report is due and ending on December 31. The report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of the reporting period.

(ii) Subsequent reporting periods begin every January 1 and end on December 31. Subsequent reports shall be submitted within 30 days following the end of the reporting period.

(iii) The periodic reports must con-tain the information included in para-graph (e)(2) of this section.

(f) *Notification of process change*. Whenever a process change is made, or a change in any of the information sub-mitted in the Notification of Compli-ance Status Report, the owner or oper-ator shall submit a report within 180 days after the process change is made or as a part of the next Periodic Report as required under paragraph (e) of this section, whichever is sooner. The re-port shall include:

(1) A brief description of the process change;

(2) A description of any modification to standard procedures or quality as-surance procedures;

(3) Revisions to any of the informa-tion reported in the original Notifica-tion of Compliance Status Report under paragraph (d) of this section; and

(4) Information required by the Noti-fication of Compliance Status Report under paragraph (d) of this section for changes involving the addition of proc-esses or equipment.

(g) *Electronic reporting*. (1) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (defined in Â§63.2) as required by this subpart you must sub-mit the results of the performance tests required by this subpart to EPA'S WebFIRE database by using the Com-pliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) that is accessed through EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (www.epa.gov/cdx). Performance test data must be submitted in the file format generated through use of EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) (see http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/
index.html). Only data collected using

Â§ 63.776

test methods on the ERT Web site are subject to this requirement for submit-ting reports electronically to WebFIRE. Owners or operators who claim that some of the information being submitted for performance tests is confidential business information (CBI) must submit a complete ERT file including information claimed to be CBI on a compact disk or other com-monly used electronic storage media (including, but not limited to, flash drives) to EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: WebFIRE Adminis-trator, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT file with the CBI omitted must be sub-mitted to EPA via CDX as described earlier in this paragraph. At the discre-tion of the delegated authority, you must also submit these reports, includ-ing the confidential business informa-tion, to the delegated authority in the format specified by the delegated au-thority.

(2) All reports required by this sub-part not subject to the requirements in paragraph (g)(1) of this section must be sent to the Administrator at the appro-priate address listed in Â§63.13. The Ad-ministrator or the delegated authority may request a report in any form suit-able for the specific case (e.g., by com-monly used electronic media such as Excel spreadsheet, on CD or hard copy). The Administrator retains the right to require submittal of reports subject to paragraph (g)(1) of this section in paper format.

quired in this subpart.

Â§63.777 Alternative means of emission
limitation.

(a) If, in the judgment of the Admin-
istrator, an alternative means of emis-
sion limitation will achieve a reduc-
tion in HAP emissions at least equiva-
lent to the reduction in HAP emissions
from that source achieved under the
applicable requirements in Â§Â§ 63.764
through 63.771, the Administrator will
publish in the FEDERAL REGISTER a no-
tice permitting the use of the alter-

40 CFR Ch. I (7-1-15 Edition)

native means for purposes of compli-
ance with that requirement. The notice
may condition the permission on re-
quirements related to the operation
and maintenance of the alternative
means.

Subpart IIâNational Emission
Standards for Shipbuilding
and Ship Repair (Surface
Coating)

SOURCE: 60 FR 64336, Dec. 15, 1995, unless
otherwise noted.

$63.780 Relationship of subpart II to
subpart A of this part.

Table 1 of this subpart specifies the
provisions of subpart A of this part
that apply to owners and operators of
sources subject to the provisions of
this subpart.

Â§63.781 Applicability.

(a) The provisions of this subpart
apply to shipbuilding and ship repair
operations at any facility that is a
major source.

(b) The provisions of this subpart do
not apply to coatings used in volumes
of less than 200 liters (52.8 gallons) per
year, provided the total volume of
coating exempt under this paragraph
does not exceed 1,000 liters per year (264
gallons per year) at any facility. Coat-
ings exempt under this paragraph shall
be clearly labeled as "low-usage ex-
empt," and the volume of each such
coating applied shall be maintained in
the facility's records.

(c) The provisions of this subpart do
not apply to coatings applied with
hand-held, nonrefillable, aerosol con-
tainers or to unsaturated polyester
resin (i.e., fiberglass lay-up) coatings.
Coatings applied to suitably prepared
fiberglass surfaces for protective or
decorative purposes are subject to this
subpart.

(d) If you are authorized in accord-
ance with 40 CFR 63.783(c) to use an
add-on control system as an alter-
native means of limiting emissions
from coating operations, in response to
an action to enforce the standards set
forth in this subpart, you may assert
an affirmative defense to a claim for
civil penalties for exceedances of such
