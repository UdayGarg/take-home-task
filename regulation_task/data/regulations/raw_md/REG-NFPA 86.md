NFPA® 86

Standard for

Ovens and Furnaces

2015 Edition

This edition of NFPA 86, *Standard for Ovens and Furnaces*, was prepared by the Technical
Committee on Ovens and Furnaces. It was issued by the Standards Council on April 29, 2014,
with an effective date of May 19, 2014, and supersedes all previous editions.

This edition of NFPA 86 was approved as an American National Standard on May 19, 2014.

Origin and Development of NFPA 86

The history of the NFPA standards for ovens and furnaces goes back to NBFU 34, *Regula-
tions of the Board of Fire Underwriters for Finishing Processes (other than paint spraying) Dip Tanks,
Hardening and Tempering Tanks, Flow Coat Work, Japanning and Enameling Including Ovens as
Recommended by the National Fire Protection Association*, which was issued in 1926. Subsequently,
the ovens part of NBFU 34 was separated and issued as NBFU 86, *Regulations of the National
Board of Fire Underwriters for Ovens For Japan, Enamel, and Other Flammable Finishes as Recommended
by the National Fire Protection Association*, in 1931. In 1948, NBFU 86 became NFPA 86-T, *Tentative
Standards for Class A Oven Design, Location and Equipment*. The document was issued as a stan-
dard in 1950 and titled NFPA 86, *Standards for Class A Ovens and Furnace Design, Location and
Equipment*.

The 1985 edition of NFPA 86 was the first edition of the standard in its current form. It was
created from the combination of the former NFPA 86A, *Standard for Ovens and Furnaces —
Design, Location and Equipment*, and NFPA 86B, *Standard for Industrial Furnaces — Design, Loca-
tion and Equipment*.

The committee introduced changes in the definitions of Class A and Class B ovens, which
were published in the 1982 edition of NFPA 86B and added as a tentative interim amendment
in 1983 to the 1977 edition of NFPA 86A. The changes in the definitions eliminated the
principal differences between the two standards, except for the ventilation requirements
contained in NFPA 86A. By providing a separate chapter for ventilation requirements in the
1985 edition (Chapter 5), the Committee found it was no longer necessary or desirable to
maintain two separate documents that addressed the same subjects.

The changes that were incorporated into the 1985 edition included the following:

(1) A new chapter dealing with low-oxygen atmosphere ovens was added.

(2) The definitions of subjects contained in the text were updated and new definitions pro-
vided.

(3) The text was refined in an effort to make the document more understandable.

(4) The material was rearranged to comply with the *NFPA Manual of Style*.

The 1995 edition of NFPA 86 correlated with NFPA 86C, *Standard for Industrial Furnaces
Using a Special Processing Atmosphere*, and NFPA 86D, *Standard for Industrial Furnaces Using
Vacuum as an Atmosphere*. It also refined and updated the standard to more current technolo-
gies, provided increased requirements in several areas, and expanded the explanatory mate-
rial in the appendixes.

The 1999 edition of NFPA 86 included changes to the technical requirements in several
areas and many refinements that clarified the technical requirements. Changes were also
provided to more clearly distinguish mandatory requirements from nonmandatory recom-
mendations and explanatory material. Nonmandatory notes were relocated to the appen-
dixes.

OVENS AND FURNACES

The 2003 edition of NFPA 86 was a complete revision that incorporated NFPA 86C, *Standard for Industrial Furnaces Using a Special Processing Atmosphere*, and NFPA 86D, *Standard for Industrial Furnaces Using Vacuum as an Atmosphere*. This new, combined document provided one standard for ovens and furnaces of all types. Also, in accordance with the *Manual of Style for NFPA Technical Committee Documents*, referenced publications were listed in Chapter 2 and all definitions moved to Chapter 3.

The 2007 edition of NFPA 86 continued to bring the standard into compliance with the *Manual of Style for NFPA Technical Committee Documents* and to update requirements. Requirements for logic systems and programmable logic controller-based systems replaced the requirement that programmable logic controllers be specifically listed for combustion safety service, since listed controllers were no longer available. Unenforceable text was (1) revised to be enforceable, (2) deleted, or (3) relocated to Annex A. Where appropriate, repetitive text was replaced by tables. The former Chapter 14, Inspection, Testing and Maintenance, was renumbered and renamed as Chapter 7, Commission-ing, Operations, Maintenance, Inspection, and Testing. Requirements for operations and maintenance throughout the standard were then relocated to that chapter.

In the 2011 edition, the scope of NFPA 86 was clarified to exclude fluid heaters, and reference was made to the new NFPA 87, *Recommended Practice for Fluid Heaters*. All requirements for fire protection were relocated to Chapter 9. Chapter 13, which covers Class C furnaces, was revised to clarify the requirements for the introduction and removal of special atmospheres. The requirements for repeated pre-ignition purge were revised to recognize the unique characteristics of ovens utilizing pulse firing of burners. In addition, the requirements for safety shutoff valves that must close when a burner experiences a loss of flame signal were clarified.

The 2015 edition of NFPA 86 includes several changes to Chapter 3 due to the addition of definitions for *burner management system, flame failure response time, flame detector, hardwired, combustion safeguard*, and *pressure regulator* types. The Committee also deleted requirements from Chapter 12 applicable to arc melting furnaces (or electric arc furnaces) as the provisions have not been maintained and the Committee no longer has the relevant expertise. The Committee added procedures for placing equipment into service based on purging practices in NFPA 54 and NFPA 56. The Committee modified the standard to clarify the types of acceptable devices used for combustion safety service. The Committee added a requirement prohibiting manifolding vent lines from different pressure levels. As a result of introducing definitions for *burner management system* and *combustion safeguard*, the Committee modified requirements in Chapter 8 for logic systems for both BMS logic and programmable logic controller (PLC) systems. The Committee modified requirements for Class A and Class C ovens and furnaces, including the development of new requirements on fire protection and safety ventilation for Class A ovens.

(293.1 kW) burner rating.

(3) The products of combustion shall be adjusted for the
oven operating temperature and the altitude.

(4) The adjusted value shall be added to the value deter-

shall be based on the percentage of volatile content of the
powder released (R) during the oven cure cycle. If a per-
centage is not available, the safety ventilation shall be cal-
culated by assuming that 9 percent of the mass of the
powder is volatile and the remaining mass is inert.

(2) The safety ventilation shall then be determined by treat-
ing the volatile components released as xylene in accor-
dance with 11.6.8.4 for continuous process ovens and with
11.6.9.3 for batch process ovens.

11.6.8* Continuous Process Ovens.

50 percent of the LFL

11.6.8.2 Where a continuous solvent vapor indicator and con-
troller is provided, it shall be arranged to do one of the follow-
ing to prevent the vapor concentration in the oven exhaust
from exceeding 50 percent of the LFL:

(1) Alarm and shut down the oven heating systems

(2) Alarm and operate additional exhaust fans

(3) Alarm and shut down the solvent input to the oven

11.6.8.3* LFL Correction Factor.

(A) The LFL value for continuous process ovens shall be cor-
rected for the oven operating temperature in accordance with
one of the following formulas or by using Table 11.6.8.3(A):

[11.6.8.3(A)]

solvent by using one of the following equations:





$ \frac{\text{ft³ vapor}}{\text{gal solvent}} = \left( \frac{8.328}{0.075} \right) \left( \frac{SpGr}{VD} \right) $





$ \frac{\text{m³ vapor}}{\text{L solvent}} = \left( \frac{0.998}{1.200} \right) \left( \frac{SpGr}{VD} \right) $







[11.6.8.4(A)a]

where:

1 gal water = 8.328 lb at 70°F

Dry air at 70°F = 0.075 lb/ft³ and 29.9 in. Hg

$SpGr$ = specific gravity of solvent (water = 1.0)

$VD$ = vapor density of solvent vapor (air = 1.0)

1 L water = 0.998 kg at 21°C

Dry air at 21°C = 1200 kg/m³ and 0.76 m Hg

(2) Determine the volume of barely explosive mixture per
amount of solvent using one of the following equations:





$ \frac{\text{ft³ barely explosive mixture}}{\text{gal solvent}} = \left( \frac{\text{ft³}}{\text{gal solvent}} \right) \left( \frac{100}{LFL_T} \right) $







$ \frac{\text{m³ barely explosive vapor}}{\text{L solvent}} = \left( \frac{\text{m³}}{\text{L solvent}} \right) \left( \frac{100}{LFL_T} \right) $





[11.6.8.4(A)b]

where:

$LFL_T$ = lower flammable limit (percentage by volume in
air), corrected for temperature

(C)* Method for Estimating Solvent Safety Ventilation Rate.
Continuous process ovens shall have a rate of safety ventilation
for volatile materials of 12,000 ft³ (340 m³) of fresh air re-
ferred to 70°F (21°C) (at sea level) per 1 gal (3.8L) of solvent
evaporated in the oven, where all the following conditions are
met:

(1) The elevation is below 1000 ft (305 m).

(2) The oven operating temperature is at or below 350°F
(177°C).

(3) The volume of air that dilutes the vapor from 1 gal of
solvent to the lower flammable limit (LFL) rendered
barely flammable for the solvent used is less than
2640 scf/gal (19.75 standard m³/L).

(4) The rate of safety ventilation is corrected for the tempera-
ture of the exhaust stream exiting the oven.

11.6.8.5* The required minimum rate of exhaust air flow, at
standard atmosphere and temperature, shall be determined
by multiplying the cubic feet of diluted mixture at 25 percent
LFL per gallon of solvent evaporated in the process by the
maximum allowable gallons per minute of solvent entering
the process oven, as follows:





$ \text{ft³ or m³ of exhaust to} \atop \text{prove safety ventilation} $ = $ \left( \frac{\text{gal or L of solvent} \atop \text{entering the oven}}{\text{min}} \right) $ $ \left( \frac{\text{ft³ or m³ diluted mixture} \atop \text{@ 25\% LFL}}{\text{gal or L of solvent evaporated}} \right) $





[11.6.8.5]

shall be corrected for the exhaust stream temperature and
altitude to determine the actual flow, as follows:

vided to ensure that the maximum solvent vapor concentra-
tion cannot exceed 25 percent of the LFL during operation.

11.6.9.3.

(A) Method for Calculating Ventilation Rate. The minimum
safety ventilation rate shall be one of the following:

(a) The controller is arranged to alarm and shut down
the oven heating system.
(b) The controller is arranged to operate additional ex-
haust fans at a predetermined vapor concentration
not exceeding 50 percent of the LFL. The amount of
ventilation air in standard cubic feet (standard cubic
meters) that is rendered barely flammable by the va-
por generated in gallons per hour (liters per hour) of
solvent in use is determined, and the determined
value then is multiplied by an empirical factor of 10
and divided by 60 minutes/hour to obtain the safety
ventilation in standard cubic feet per minute (stan-
dard cubic meters per minute).

(B) Method for Estimating Rate of Ventilation. Batch ovens
shall have a minimum safety ventilation rate either of that
given in 11.6.9.3 or as follows:

(1) The safety ventilation rate of batch ovens shall be de-
signed and maintained to provide 440 scfm of air per gal
(3.29 standard m³/min of air per L) of flammable vola-
tiles in each batch.
(2) *Where the solvent used requires a volume of air greater than
2640 standard ft³ to dilute vapor from 1 gal of solvent to the
LFL (19.75 standard m³/L), safety ventilation shall be ad-
justed in proportion to the ratio of the actual volume of air
necessary to render 2640 ft³/gal (19.75 m³/L) barely explo-
sive.

CAUTION: Caution shall be used where applying this method
to products of low mass that can heat up quickly (such as paper
or textiles) or materials coated with very highly volatile sol-
vents. Either condition can produce too high a peak evapora-
tion rate for this method to be used.

11.6.9.4* Correction factors shall be applied as follows:

(1) The temperature correction factor determined in 11.6.5.1
shall be applied to adjust for the impact of temperature on
exhaust efficiency.
(2) The altitude correction factor determined in 11.6.5.2
shall be applied to adjust for the impact of temperature
on exhaust efficiency.

at least one heating zone is operating at or above 25 percent of
the LFL, all other heating zones shall be equipped with either
of the following:

(1) A continuous vapor concentration high limit controller
(2) Without a continuous vapor concentration high limit con-
troller where it can be demonstrated that a heating zone
cannot exceed 25 percent of the LFL in the case of an
accidental increase in solvent input

11.6.10.4* Where a continuous vapor concentration control-
ler is used to modulate the flow of fresh air or exhaust from an
oven or zone, the following criteria shall apply:

(1) A secondary protection system shall be required to prevent
an analyzer failure from causing a hazardous condition.
(2) The secondary protection system shall have a separate
continuous vapor concentration high limit controller for
each zone.
(3) Limits on damper travel (set for 50 percent LFL for the
highest design solvent input) for each zone shall be per-
mitted in lieu of the requirement of 11.6.10.3(2).

11.6.10.5 The continuous vapor concentration controller
and the continuous vapor concentration high limit controller
shall be calibrated for the application and solvents used.

11.6.10.6 Where a variety of solvents is used, the solvent to
which the controller is least sensitive shall be the primary cali-
bration reference.

11.6.10.7 A record of primary and subsequent calibrations
shall be maintained and reviewed for drift in the controller
response.

11.6.10.8 Alarms shall be provided to indicate any sample,
flow, circuit, or controller power failures.

(A) Activation of an alarm shall initiate action to reduce the
solvent concentration to a minimum.
(B) The activation of the malfunction alarm shall require
operator intervention in accordance with 11.6.10.10.

11.6.10.9* Activation of the continuous vapor concentration
high limit controller shall alarm and initiate the automatic
reduction of the solvent concentration to a minimum.

11.6.10.10 When the continuous vapor concentration high
limit controller alarm (required by 11.6.10.9) is activated, the

Annex A Explanatory Material

*Annex A is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document
but is included for informational purposes only. This annex contains
explanatory material, numbered to correspond with the applicable text
paragraphs.*

A.1.1 Explosions and fires in fuel-fired and electric heat utili-
zation equipment constitute a loss potential in life, property,
and production. This standard is a compilation of guidelines,
rules, and methods applicable to the safe operation of this
type of equipment.

Conditions and regulations that are not covered in this
standard such as toxic vapors, hazardous materials, noise
levels, heat stress, and local, state, and federal regulations
(EPA and OSHA) should be considered in the design and
operation of furnaces.

Most failures can be traced to human error. The most sig-
nificant failures include inadequate training of operators, lack
of proper maintenance, and improper application of equip-
ment. Users and designers must utilize engineering skill to
bring together that proper combination of controls and train-
ing necessary for the safe operation of equipment. This stan-
dard classifies furnaces as follows:

(1) Class *A ovens and furnaces* are heat utilization equipment
operating at approximately atmospheric pressure
wherein there is a potential explosion or fire hazard that
could be occasioned by the presence of flammable vola-
tiles or combustible materials processed or heated in the
furnace. Such flammable volatiles or combustible materi-
als can originate from any of the following:

(a) Paints, powders, inks, and adhesives from finishing
processes, such as dipped, coated, sprayed, and im-
pregnated materials

(b) Substrate material

(c) Wood, paper, and plastic pallets, spacers, or packag-
ing materials

(d) Polymerization or other molecular rearrangements

Potentially flammable materials, such as quench oil, water-
borne finishes, cooling oil, and cooking oils, that present a
hazard are ventilated according to Class A standards.

(2) Class *B ovens and furnaces* are heat utilization equipment op-
erating at approximately atmospheric pressure wherein no
flammable volatiles or combustible materials are being
heated.

(3) Class *C ovens and furnaces* are those in which there is a poten-
tial hazard due to a flammable or other special atmosphere
being used for treatment of material in process. This type of

furnace can use any type of heating system and includes a
special atmosphere supply system(s). Also included in the
Class C classification are integral quench furnaces and mol-
ten salt bath furnaces.

(4) *Class D furnaces* are vacuum furnaces that operate at tem-
peratures that exceed ambient to over 5000°F (2760°C)
and at pressures from vacuum to several atmospheres dur-
ing heating using any type of heating system. These fur-
naces can include the use of special processing atmo-
spheres. During gas quenching, these furnaces can
operate at pressures from below atmospheric to over a
gauge pressure of 100 psi (690 kPa).

A.1.1.6 Vacuum furnaces generally are described as cold-wall
furnaces, hot-wall furnaces, or furnaces used for casting or
melting of metal at high temperatures up to 5000°F (2760°C).
There can be other special types.

For more detailed information on the various types of fur-
naces, see Table A.1.1.6. See Figure A.1.1.6(a) through Fig-
ure A.1.1.6(c) for examples of a cold-wall, horizontal, front-
loading vacuum furnace; a cold-wall, induction-heated vacuum
furnace; and a hot-wall, single-pumped, retort vacuum furnace.

*Plasma Melting.* Plasma melting is a process by which metal
solids, powders, chips, and fines are consolidated into ingot or
slab form. Melting is accomplished by use of an ionized gas
that transfers heat from the plasma torch to the material. The
gas might be oxidizing, reducing, or inert, depending on the
process requirements. The temperature of the plasma gas is in
excess of 3632°F (2000°C). Material consolidation might be in
the form of an ingot, usually extracted from the bottom of the
melt chamber, or a slab that is removed horizontally from the
melt chamber.

The melt chamber operating pressure might vary from
10-2 atmospheres to 2 atmospheres, making the process suit-
able for a wide variety of metals and alloys. Cleaning and re-
finement of the material might be accomplished by the use of
hearth melting, stirring action by torch manipulation, induc-
tive stirring coils, or vacuum/pressure cycling of the melt
chamber.

The melt chamber, torches, copper hearths, consolidation
containment system, and power supplies are water cooled.
Each water-cooled circuit is monitored for low flow and high
temperature, with alarms for all circuits, power disruption for
critical circuits, or both.

Solid-state power supplies are utilized to provide power to the
torches, which range in size from 47 Btu/hr (50 kW) for a small
research unit to multiple torches of 948 Btu/hr (1000 kW) each
for large production melters. The torches provide x, y, and z
movements that are programmable or computer controlled. [*See*
*Figure A.1.1.6(d).*]

*Electron-Beam (EB) Melting.* Of all commercial melting tech-
niques, electron-beam (EB) melting is capable of producing
the highest refinement of end product. The beam of the elec-
tron gun can be focused to produce heat intense enough to
vaporize even those metals with the highest melting points.
Where combined with a vacuum atmosphere of approximately
104 torr (1.3 × 10-6 Pa), most impurities can be separated
from the product being melted. EB melting is especially suited
for refining refractory metals and highly reactive metals, but it
also has applications in melting alloy steels.

Commercial EB melters are available in a variety of sizes
and configurations. Figure A.1.1.6(e) illustrates a vertical feed
system that allows the molten metal to drop from the feed
stock into a water-cooled copper retention hearth, where the
molten metal is further refined by the oscillating beams of the
two guns. The retention time of the metal in the hearth is
controlled by adjusting the melt rate of the feedstock. The
metal flows over a weir at the end of the hearth and falls into a
water-cooled chill ring, where it solidifies into a billet as it is
withdrawn downward from the chamber. Vaporized impurities
condense on the cold inner walls of the vacuum chamber or
on special collector plates that are easily removed for clean-
ing. Because of the intense heat needed for the melting and
refining process, the vacuum chamber is usually of double-
wall construction so that large quantities of cooling water can
circulate through the passages of the chamber.

*Vacuum Arc Melting and Vacuum Arc Skull Casting.* Vacuum
arc melting is a high-volume production method for alloying
and refining metals. Alloys can be produced by sandwiching
and welding strips of different metals together to produce an
electrode that, after melting, results in the desired alloy. Sec-
ond and third melts are sometimes necessary to refine the
alloy. Most arc melters are of the consumable electrode type;
however, nonconsumable electrode melters are commercially
available. Figure A.1.1.6(f) illustrates the principal compo-
nents of one type of consumable electrode arc melter.

In operation, dc voltage potential is established between
the stinger rod, which has the electrode attached to it, and the
water-cooled copper melt cup. The stinger rod is driven down
until an arc is established between the electrode and a metal
disk placed in the bottom of the melt cup. Once the arc has
stabilized and melting begins, the voltage might be reduced,
thus shortening the arc length and lessening the possibility of
arcing to the water-cooled sidewall of the cup.

Automatic control systems are available for controlling the
arc length and melt rates. A mechanical booster pumping sys-
tem provides vacuum operating levels of approximately
102 torr (1.3 × 10-4 Pa). Water-cooling circuits are provided
for the stinger rod, head, melt cup, solid-state power supply,
cables and connections, and vacuum pumping system.

The vacuum arc skull caster is a variation of the vacuum arc melter, with the essential difference that, instead of melting the electrode into a copper cup and allowing the molten metal to solidify, the electrode is melted into a cold-wall cop- per crucible. The crucible then is tilted, allowing the molten metal to pour into a casting mold, leaving a solidified metal lining, or "skull," in the crucible.

Burn-throughs into water jackets, which allow water to come in contact with hot metal, are not uncommon in arc melting. Equipment damage can be minimized by providing overpressure-relief ports, reliable cooling water sources, well- designed and monitored cooling circuits, and well-trained op- erators. Blast protection walls are frequently installed for per- sonnel protection.

A.1.1.7(1) Designing coal or other solid fuel-firing systems requires special knowledge and experience with such solid fuel systems. As an example, different types of coal (anthracite vs. sub-bituminous) - and other solid fuels such as petroleum coke, wood chips, sawdust, other biomass, and combustible dusts such as medium density fiberboard dust – can intro- duce significantly different hazards and require significantly different handling systems and fuel delivery systems.

Solid fuels present unique burner control challenges. For example, there might be challenges selecting and arranging flame supervision devices, selecting the method of fuel prepa- ration and delivery, and determining actions to take in an emergency shutdown.

The best guidance from NFPA for coal-fired systems (pul- verized or aggregate) is NFPA 85, *Boiler and Combustion Systems Hazards Code*. Another resource is FM Global Property Loss Prevention Property Loss Prevention Data Sheet 6-17, "Rotary Kilns and Dryers." Burning of other solid fuels is less standard- ized. An available resource is FM Global Property Loss Preven- tion Data Sheet 6-13, "Waste Fuel Fired Boilers." Coordinating

A.1.5 No standard can guarantee the elimination of furnace
fires and explosions. Technology in this area is under constant
development, which is reflected in fuel, special processing at-
mospheres, flammable vapors, and quench systems, with re-
gard to the type of equipment and the characteristics of the
various fluids. Therefore, the designer is cautioned that this
standard is not a design handbook and thus does not elimi-
nate the need for an engineer or competent engineering judg-
ment. It is the intention of this standard that a designer ca-
pable of applying more complete and rigorous analysis to
special or unusual problems have latitude in the development
of furnace designs. In such cases, the designer should be re-
sponsible for demonstrating and documenting the safety and
validity of the design.

A.3.2.1 Approved. The National Fire Protection Association
does not approve, inspect, or certify any installations, proce-
dures, equipment, or materials; nor does it approve or evalu-
ate testing laboratories. In determining the acceptability of
installations, procedures, equipment, or materials, the author-
ity having jurisdiction may base acceptance on compliance
with NFPA or other appropriate standards. In the absence of
such standards, said authority may require evidence of proper
installation, procedure, or use. The authority having jurisdic-
tion may also refer to the listings or labeling practices of an
organization that is concerned with product evaluations and is
thus in a position to determine compliance with appropriate
standards for the current production of listed items.

A.3.2.2 Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). The phrase "au-
thority having jurisdiction," or its acronym AHJ, is used in
NFPA documents in a broad manner, since jurisdictions and
approval agencies vary, as do their responsibilities. Where pub-
lic safety is primary, the authority having jurisdiction may be a
federal, state, local, or other regional department or indi-
vidual such as a fire chief; fire marshal; chief of a fire preven-
tion bureau, labor department, or health department; build-
ing official; electrical inspector; or others having statutory
authority. For insurance purposes, an insurance inspection de-
partment, rating bureau, or other insurance company repre-
sentative may be the authority having jurisdiction. In many
circumstances, the property owner or his or her designated
agent assumes the role of the authority having jurisdiction; at
government installations, the commanding officer or depart-
mental official may be the authority having jurisdiction.

A.3.2.4 Listed. The means for identifying listed equipment
may vary for each organization concerned with product evalu-
ation; some organizations do not recognize equipment as
listed unless it is also labeled. The authority having jurisdic-
tion should utilize the system employed by the listing organi-
zation to identify a listed product.

A.3.3.6 Burner Management System. The burner manage-
ment system logic can include the following functions: safety
interlocks, pre-purge, trial for ignition, and safe-start check.

A.3.3.13 Cryogenic Fluid. In the context of this standard, cryo-
genic fluid generally refers to gases made at low temperatures and
stored at the user site in an insulated tank for use as an inert
purge gas or as an atmosphere or atmosphere constituent (e.g.,
nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, oxygen). Cryogenic
fluids must be stored and piped in vessels and piping that con-
form to the requirements for low-temperature fluids in the appli-
cable NFPA, CGA, ANSI, and ASME standards.

A.3.3.14 Cut-Away Damper. Cut-away dampers normally are
placed in the exhaust or fresh air intake ducts to ensure that
the required minimum amount of exhaust or fresh air is
handled by the ventilating fans.

A.3.3.16 Explosion-Resistant (Radiant Tube). The radiant
tube or the radiant tube heat recovery system can experience
bulging and distortion but should not fail catastrophically.

A.3.3.20 Flame Propagation Rate. This rate is a function of
the temperature and the mixture conditions existing in the
combustion space, burner, or piping under consideration.

A.3.3.21 Flame Rod. The resulting electrical current, which
passes through the flame, is rectified, and this rectified cur-
rent is amplified by the flame detector.

A.3.3.22 Flammable Limits. LFL is also known as lower explo-
sive limit (LEL). See ASTM E 681, Standard Test Method for Con-
centration Limits of Flammability of Chemicals (Vapors and Gases).

A.3.3.27.3 Class A Furnace. Flammable volatiles or combus-
tible materials can include, but are not limited to, any of the
following:

(1) Paints, powders, inks, and adhesives from finishing pro-
cesses, such as dipped, coated, sprayed, and impregnated
materials
(2) Substrate material
(3) Wood, paper, and plastic pallets, spacers, or packaging
materials
(4) Polymerization or other molecular rearrangements

In addition, potentially flammable materials, such as
quench oil, waterborne finishes, cooling oil, or cooking oils,
that present a hazard should be ventilated according to Class A
standards.

A.3.3.27.4 Class B Furnace. It is important to note that the
loads processed in Class B furnaces typically do not contain
any flammable volatiles or combustible materials. However,
when small amounts of flammable volatiles or combustible
materials are present, it can be appropriate not to add safety
ventilation, as would be required for a Class A furnace, when
doing so would be detrimental to the process and would not
increase the level of safety. (See A.3.3.25.3.)

A.3.3.27.5 Class C Furnace. This type of furnace uses any type
of heating system and includes a special atmosphere supply
system (s). Also included in the Class C classification are inte-
gral quench furnaces and molten salt bath furnaces.

A.3.3.27.6 Class D Furnace. During inert gas quenching,
Class D furnaces operate at pressures from below atmospheric
to over a gauge pressure of 100 psi (690 kPa).

A.3.3.30 Gas Quenching. The gas is recirculated over the
work and through a heat exchanger by means of a fan or
blower.

A.3.3.32 Hardwired. When the term hardwired is applied to
the logic system itself, it refers to the method of using indi-
vidual devices and interconnecting wiring to program and
perform the logic functions without the use of software-based
logic solvers.

A.3.3.33.1 Dielectric Heating System. This type of heater is
useful for heating materials that commonly are thought to be
nonconductive. Examples of uses include heating plastic pre-
forms before molding, curing glue in plywood, drying rayon
cakes, and other similar applications.

A.3.3.33.3 Direct-Fired Heating System. The following are dif-
ferent types of direct-fired heating systems:

(1) *Direct-Fired, External, Nonrecirculating Heater* — a direct-
fired external heater arranged so that products of com-
bustion are discharged into the oven chamber without
any return or recirculation from the oven chamber [*see*
*Figure A.3.3.33.3(a)*]

(2) *Direct-Fired, External, Recirculating-Through Heater* — a
direct-fired external heater arranged so that oven atmo-
sphere is recirculated to the oven heater and is in contact
with the burner flame [*see Figure A.3.3.33.3(b)*]

(3) *Direct-Fired, Internal, Nonrecirculating Heater* — a combus-
tion chamber of a recirculating oven heater that can be
permitted to be built within an oven chamber not sub-
stantially separated from the oven atmosphere by gastight
construction

(4) *Direct-Fired, External, Recirculating-Not-Through Heater* — a
heating system constructed so that the oven atmosphere
circulates through a blower with products of combustion
admitted to the recirculating ductwork but without the
oven atmosphere actually passing through the combus-
tion chamber [*see Figure A.3.3.33.3(c)*]

A.3.3.33.6 Indirect-Fired Internal Heating System. Radiators
might be designed to withstand explosion pressures from igni-
tion of air-fuel mixtures in the radiators. See Figure A.3.3.33.6
for an example of an indirect-fired internal heating system.

A.3.3.33.7 Induction Heating System. See *NFPA 70, National*
*Electrical Code*, Article 665.

A.3.3.33.9 Resistance Heating System. Resistance heaters can
be of the open type, with bare heating conductors, or the in-
sulated sheath type, with conductors covered by a protecting
sheath that can be filled with electrical insulating material.

A.3.3.35 Implosion. Implosion can be followed by an outward
scattering of pieces of the wall if the wall material is not duc-
tile, thus causing possible danger to nearby equipment and
personnel.

A.3.3.37 Limiting Oxidant Concentration (LOC). Materials
other than oxygen can act as oxidants.

A.3.3.40.2 Air Jet Mixer. In some cases, this type of mixer can
be designed to entrain some of the air for combustion as well
as the fuel gas.

A.3.3.48.1 Low-Oxygen Oven. These ovens normally operate
at high solvent levels and can operate safely in this manner by
limiting the oxygen concentration within the oven enclosure.

A.3.3.56.5 Roughing Pump. The roughing pump also can be
used as the backing (fore) pump for the diffusion pump, or the
roughing pump can be shut off and a smaller pump used as the
backing (fore) pump where the gas load is relatively small.

A.3.3.62 Safe-Start Check. A flame-detected condition could
exist due to the presence of actual or simulated flame or due
to component failure within the combustion safeguard or
flame detector(s).

A.3.3.63 Safety Device. Safety devices are redundant controls,
supplementing controls utilized in the normal operation of a
furnace system. Safety devices act automatically, either alone
or in conjunction with operating controls, when conditions
stray outside of design operating ranges and endanger equip-
ment or personnel.

A.3.3.69.7 Proof-of-Closure Switch. A common method of

definition of proof of closure in ANSI Z21.21/CSA 6.5, Automatic
Valves for Gas Appliances, and FM 7400, Approval Standard for
Liquid and Gas Safety Shutoff Valves, requires leakage less than
1 ft³/hr (28.32 L/hr).

A.3.3.81.1 Safety Ventilation. The maximum allowed percent
of the lower flammable limit (LFL) is 25 percent when the safety
ventilation rate is based upon the calculation methods provided
in this standard for Class A ovens. As permitted by this standard,
the maximum allowed percent of the lower flammable limit
(LFL) may range up to 50 percent when a continuous vapor con-
centration high-limit controller(s) is used.

A.4.1 Section 4.1 includes requirements for complete plans,
sequence of operations, and specifications to be submitted to
the authority having jurisdiction for approval. Application
forms such as those in Figure A.4.1 (a) and Figure A.4.1 (b) can
be used or might be requested to help the authority having
jurisdiction in this approval process. (Variations of the forms
depend on the type of furnace or oven being furnished, its
application, and the authority having jurisdiction.) These fig-
ures are two historical examples of application forms that are
based on older editions of the standard. Forms consistent with
current requirements should be used.

A.4.1.1.2 Ladder-type schematic diagrams are recommended.

A.4.1.3.1 The proximity of electrical equipment and flam-
mable gas or liquid in an electrical enclosure or panel is a
known risk and would be considered a classified area. Article
500 of NFPA 70, National Electrical Code, should be consulted.
If conduit that connects devices that handle flammable ma-
terial fails, it might carry the material to an electrical enclo-
sure, creating a classified area in that enclosure. Sealing of
such conduits should be considered.

A.4.1.3.4 Unless otherwise required by the local environ-
ment, ovens and furnaces and the surrounding area are not
classified as a hazardous (classified) location. The primary
source of ignition associated with an oven installation is the
oven heating system or equipment or the materials heated.
The presence of these ignition sources precludes the need for
imposing requirements for wiring methods appropriate for a
hazardous (classified) location. Refer to NFPA 497, Recom-
mended Practice for the Classification of Flammable Liquids, Gases, or

Vapors and of Hazardous (Classified) Locations for Electrical Instal-
lations in Chemical Process Areas, and NFPA 499, Recommended
Practice for the Classification of Combustible Dusts and of Hazardous
(Classified) Locations for Electrical Installations in Chemical Process
Areas, regarding equipment with open flames or other igni-
tion sources.

In addition, ovens and furnaces are considered unclassi-
fied internally because proved ventilation is provided to en-
sure safety.

A.5.1.1.1 Hazards to be considered include molten metal,
molten salt, or other molten material spillage, quench tanks,
hydraulic oil ignition, overheating of material in the furnace,
and escape of fuel, processing atmospheres, or flue gases.

A.5.1.1.4 For additional information, refer to NFPA 31, Stan-
dard for the Installation of Oil-Burning Equipment, NFPA 54, Na-
tional Fuel Gas Code, and NFPA 91, Standard for Exhaust Systems
for Air Conveying of Vapors, Gases, Mists, and Noncombustible Par-
ticulate Solids.

A.5.1.3.4 The hazard is particularly severe where vapors from
dipping operations could flow by means of gravity to ignition
sources at or near floor level.
See NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code;
NFPA 33, Standard for Spray Application Using Flammable or Com-
bustible Materials; and NFPA 34, Standard for Dipping, Coating,
and Printing Processes Using Flammable or Combustible Liquids.

A.5.1.4.3 If the furnace is located in contact with a wood floor
or other combustible floor and the operating temperature is
above 160°F (71°C), one or both of the following steps should
be adequate to prevent surface temperatures of floor mem-
bers from exceeding 160°F (71°C):

(1) Combustible floor members should be removed and re-
placed with a monolithic concrete slab that extends a
minimum of 3 ft (1 m) beyond the outer extremities of
the furnace.

(2) Air channels, either naturally or mechanically ventilated,
should be provided between the floor and the equipment
(perpendicular to the axis of the equipment), or non-
combustible insulation should be provided.

A.5.2.3 Furnace design should include factors of safety so as
to avoid failures when operating at maximum design load.

A.5.2.4 Consider additional design loads, such as seismic,
precipitation, and wind loads where appropriate.

A.5.2.6.1 Ladders, walkways, and access facilities, where pro-
vided, should be designed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.24
through 29 CFR 1910.29 and with ANSI A14.3, Safety Require-
ments for Fixed Ladders.

A.5.2.10 Adequate coolant flow is vital to the safe operation
of some ovens and furnaces. Where flow switches are provided
to verify flow, they should be tested regularly. Other means,
such as flow indicators, should also be considered for supple-
menting the function of flow switches (see A.14.2.4.4).

Testing frequency should be developed from experience
and should consider water quality factors. Poor water quality
due to scaling or fouling potential and other factors may re-
quire more frequent testing. Testing intervals should not ex-
tend beyond 1 year.

ANNEX A                                                                                                                      86-71

A.5.2.13 Fuel-fired or electric heaters should not be located
directly under the product being heated where combustible
materials could drop and accumulate. Neither should they be
located directly over readily ignitible materials such as cotton
unless for a controlled exposure period, as in continuous pro-
cesses where additional automatic provisions, arrangements
of guard baffles, or both preclude the possibility of ignition.

A.5.2.16 See ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII.
Also see API 510, Pressure Vessel Inspection Code: In-Service Inspec-
tion, Rating, Repair, and Alteration, and API 570, Piping Inspection
Code: Inspection, Repair, Alteration, and Rerating of In-Service Pip-
ing Systems. Where subject to corrosion, metal parts should be
adequately protected.

A.5.3 Explosion hazards can be mitigated by the following
methods:

(1) Containment
(2) Explosion relief
(3) Location
(4) Explosion suppression
(5) Damage-limiting construction

For additional information regarding explosion protection
of equipment and buildings, see NFPA 68, Standard on Explo-
sion Protection by Deflagration Venting, and NFPA 69, Standard on
Explosion Prevention Systems.

A.5.3.1 For additional information regarding relief of equip-
ment and buildings housing the equipment, see NFPA 68,
Standard on Explosion Protection by Deflagration Venting.

A.5.3.1(6) Because the combustion air has only one path
from the combustion blower through the supervised powered
exhaust, there is no buildup of products of combustion in the
heat exchanger. The minimum exhaust rate for the heat ex-
changer should be determined using 11.6.6.1, which states
183 scfm (5.18 standard m³/min) per 1,000,000 Btu/hr
(293.1 kW) burner rating. Refer to Figure A.5.3.1 (6).

A.5.3.2 The intent of providing explosion relief in furnaces is
to limit damage to the furnace and to reduce the risk of per-
sonnel injury due to explosions.

> [Figure] Diagram of a non-recirculating, indirect-fired oven. The major components are labeled and include the oven, combustion blower burner, supply fan, powered exhaust, combustion chamber, and exhaust.


The historic application of the 1 ft² (0.093 m²) of relief
area for each 15 ft³ (0.424 m³) of volume, which is based on
industry experience and traditional construction methods,
has provided an acceptable level of damage control and per-
sonnel protection. Furthermore, controls on fuel concentra-
tion (e.g., safety shutoff valves, safety ventilation interlocks)
ensure that an upset condition results in only a localized con-
centration of flammable vapors within the oven volume, thus
limiting the energy of the deflagration.

However, the oven designer, manufacturer, and end user
should review their specific application and consider the prob-
ability of abnormal or "upset" conditions that could lead to
concentrations in excess of 25 percent of the LFL distributed
throughout the oven volume. A worst-case event involving an
explosive mixture distributed throughout the oven volume is
likely to require construction and venting design in accor-
dance with NFPA 68, Standard on Explosion Protection by Deflagra-
tion Venting, to avoid catastrophic failure of the oven and haz-
ard to personnel and equipment in the vicinity.

Users of this standard are also encouraged to seek out innova-
tive solutions for deflagration venting as a means of overcoming
impracticalities associated with traditional venting solutions.
Such innovative solutions include weak seam or weak joint con-
struction, damage-limiting construction, self-relieving enclo-
sures, tethered panels, and lifting enclosures. As with any defla-
gration venting solution, personnel protection is to be
considered foremost in the event of a vent-relieving incident.

A.5.3.5 The location for explosion relief is a critical concern
and should be close to the ignition source. The heater box is part
of the oven system and needs to have explosion relief provided.
Personnel considerations and proximity to other obstructions
can affect the location selected for explosion-relief vents.

A.5.3.7 Industry experience indicates that a typical oven enclo-
sure built to withstand a minimum of a gauge pressure of 0.5 psi
(3.45 kPa) surge overpressure with explosion-relief panels having
a maximum weight per area of 5 lb/ft² (24.4 kg/m²) meets the
requirements of 5.3.7.

A.5.3.8 The intent of providing explosion relief in furnaces is
to limit damage to the furnace and to reduce the risk of per-
sonnel injury due to explosions. To achieve those goals, relief
panels and doors should be sized so that their inertia does not
preclude their ability to relieve internal explosion pressures.

A.5.4 For additional information, refer to NFPA 31, Standard for
the Installation of Oil-Burning Equipment, NFPA 54, National Fuel Gas
Code, and NFPA 91, Standard for Exhaust Systems for Air Conveying of
Vapors, Gases, Mists, and Noncombustible Particulate Solids.

A.5.4.1 Most ovens and furnaces rely on the air in a building
or room for safety ventilation and combustion. If the oven or
furnace fans must compete with other building fans (such as
building exhausts), safety and performance of the oven or fur-
nace could be compromised.

When determining or reviewing the air requirements of a
building or room for safety ventilation and combustion, provi-
sions should be made for air being removed from the room
for other purposes, such as for removal of heat, flue products,
emergency generators, and other combustion equipment.
Safety ventilation and combustion air must be in excess of air
that is to be removed from the room for other purposes. Sea-
sonal factors could also be relevant in cold climates, where
building openings are closed during cold weather.

86-72 OVENS AND FURNACES

In the case of ovens and furnaces, especially those using
natural draft (such as bakery ovens), combustion air consis-
tent with requirements identified in Section 9.3 of NFPA 54,
National Fuel Gas Code, should be provided.

A.5.4.3.3 Ducts that pass through fire walls should be avoided.

A.5.4.3.7 All interior laps in the duct joints should be made
in the direction of the flow.

A.5.4.3.13 In many cases, the point of discharge is outside the
building, and care should be taken that the discharge is not
near an intake or building opening. However, in some cases,
the building volume itself is a point of safe discharge, in which
case the discharge should not be near areas in which volatiles
can collect (unvented ceilings) or intakes (combustion/purge
air intakes). Heavier-than-air effluents should not be dis-
charged to the inside of a building.

A.6.2 The recommendations of equipment manufacturers
should be followed when using gaseous fuels that are not spe-
cifically listed in the product literature. For installations using
digester gas or landfill gas, CSA B149.6, *Code for Digester Gas and
Landfill Gas Installations*, formerly CSA B105, is a recom-
mended resource because it contains safety practices that
should be addressed due to the inherent hazards, which are
not specifically addressed in NFPA 86, with these types of
gases, such as but not limited to oxygen, moisture, or hydro-
gen sulfide in the gas; use of such gases for a pilot; purging of
the gas train; types of materials; or special pressure relief of a
digester.

The term *ignition temperature* means the lowest temperature at
which a gas-air mixture will ignite and continue to burn. This
condition is also referred to as the auto-ignition temperature. Where
burners supplied with a gas-air mixture in the flammable range
are heated above the auto-ignition temperature, flashbacks could
occur. In general, such temperatures range from 870°F to 1300°F
(465°C to 704°C). A much higher temperature is needed to ig-
nite gas dependably. The temperature necessary is slightly higher
for natural gas than for manufactured gases; for safety with
manufactured gases, a temperature of about 1200°F (649°C) is
needed, and for natural gas, a temperature of about 1400°F
(760°C) is needed. Additional safety considerations should be
given to dirt-laden gases, sulfur-laden gases, high-hydrogen gases,
and low-Btu waste gases.

The term rate of *flame propagation* means the speed at which
a flame progresses through a combustible gas-air mixture un-
der the pressure, temperature, and mixture conditions exist-
ing in the combustion space, burner, or piping under consid-
eration. (See Table A.6.2 and Figure A.6.2.)

A.6.2.2 For additional information, refer to NFPA 54, *National
Fuel Gas Code*.

A.6.2.2.4 See A.5.4.1 for information on combustion air sup-
ply considerations.

Α.6.2.3.1 The valve used for remote shutoff service should be
identified. A number of considerations, including the ability
to safely shut down special atmosphere heat treat furnaces,
might play a role. If the main incoming service valve is used for
this purpose, it must be understood that the valve might be
owned by the local utility, which could affect access and service
of the valve. Remotely located valves used for shutting down
fuel distribution systems that serve a number of users or pieces
of equipment should be regularly exercised (by opening and
closing several times) to verify their ability to operate when
needed. Lubricated plug valves should be maintained annu-
ally, including the installation of sealant and leak testing.

A.6.2.4.2 NFPA 54, *National Fuel Gas Code*, provides sizing
methods for gas piping systems.

A.6.2.5.3 When the fuel train is opened for service, the risk of
dirt entry exists. It is not required that existing piping be
opened for the sole purpose of the addition of a filter or
strainer. It is good practice to have the sediment trap located
upstream of the filter. The intent of the sediment trap is to
remove larger particulates, while the intent of the filter is to
remove smaller particulates. The reverse arrangement will re-
sult in additional maintenance and could result in removal of
the filter element from service. The mesh size should be sized
to protect downstream controls as prescribed by the compo-
nents' manufacturer(s).

A.6.2.6.3 Paragraph 6.2.6.3 covers venting of flammable and
oxidizing gases only. Gases that are asphyxiants, toxic, or cor-
rosive are outside of the scope of this standard. In this regard,
other standards should be consulted for appropriate venting.
Flammable gases and oxidizers should be vented to a safe lo-
cation to prevent fire or explosion hazards. When gases are
vented, the vent pipe should be located in accordance with the
following:

FIGURE A.6.2 Ignition Velocity Curves for Typical Flammable Gases.

(1) Gas should not impinge on equipment, support, build-
ing, windows, or materials because the gas could ignite
and create a fire hazard.

(2) Gas should not impinge on personnel at work in the area
or in the vicinity of the exit of the vent pipe because the
gas could ignite and create a fire hazard.

(3) Gas should not be vented in the vicinity of air intakes, com-
pressor inlets, or other devices that utilize ambient air.

The vent exit should be designed in accordance with the
following:

(1) The pipe exit should not be subject to physical damage or
foreign matter that could block the exit.

(2) The vent pipe should be sized to minimize the pressure
drop associated with length, fitting, and elbows at the
maximum vent flow rate.

(3) The vent piping should not have any shutoff valves in the
line.

If the gas is to be vented inside the building, the following
additional guidance is offered:

(1) If the gas is flammable and lighter than air, the flammable
gases should be vented to a location where the gas is di-
luted below its LFL before coming in contact with sources
of ignition and the gas cannot re-enter the work area with-
out extreme dilution.

(2) If the gas is oxygen or air enriched with oxygen, the vent
gas should be vented to a location where the gas will blend
with atmospheric air to a point between 19 percent and
23 percent oxygen before coming in contact with combus-
tibles or personnel.

(3) See also Chapter 4 of NFPA 56, *Standard for Fire and Explo-sion Prevention During Cleaning and Purging of Flammable Gas Piping Systems*, which provides information about the
development and implementation of written procedures
for the discharge of flammable gases.

A.6.2.6.4 See NFPA 54, *National Fuel Gas Code*, for exception
to vent requirements.

Vent limiters are used to limit the escape of gas into the ambi-
ent atmosphere if a vented device (e.g., regulator, zero governor,
pressure switch) requiring access to the atmosphere for opera-
tion has an internal component failure. When a vent limiter is
used, there might not be a need to vent the device to an approved
location. Following are some general guidelines and principles
on the use of vented devices incorporating vent limiters:

(1) The listing requirements for vent limiters are covered in
ANSI Z21.18/CSA 6.3, *Standard for Gas Appliance Pressure
Regulators*, for regulators and in ANSI/UL 353, *Standard for
Limit Controls*, for pressure switches and limit controls. ANSI
Z21.18/CSA 6.3 requires a maximum allowable leakage rate
of 2.5 ft³/hr (0.071 m³/hr) for natural gas and 1.0 ft³/hr
(0.028 m³/hr) for LP-Gas at the device's maximum rated
pressure. ANSI/UL 353 allows 1.0 ft³/hr (0.028 m³/hr) for
natural gas and 1.53 ft³/hr (0.043 m³/hr) for LP-Gas at the
device's maximum rated pressure. Since a vent limiter may
be rated less than the device itself, or it may de-rate the de-
vice to a lower pressure rating, a combination listed device-
vent limiter should be used.

(2) Where a vent limiter is used, there should be adequate air-
flow through the room or enclosure in which the equipment
is installed. In reality, conditions can be less ideal, and care
should be exercised for the following reasons:

(a) The relative density of the gas influences its ability to
disperse in air. The higher the relative density, the
more difficult it is for the gas to disperse (e.g., pro-
pane disperses more slowly than natural gas).

2015 Edition ![NFPA logo] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 77

86-74 OVENS AND FURNACES

(b) Airflow patterns through a room or enclosure, espe-cially in the vicinity of the gas leak, affect the ability of the air to dilute that gas. The greater the local air movement, the greater the ease with which the gas is able to disperse.
(c) The vent limiter may not prevent the formation of a localized flammable air-gas concentration for the preceding reasons.
(3) Table A.6.2.6.4 shows various gases and their equivalent allowable leakage rates through a vent limiting device as per ANSI Z21.18/CSA 6.3, *Standard for Gas Appliance Pressure Regulator*.

The leakage rates are based on the maximum pressure rating for the device.

Table A.6.2.6.4 Allowable Leakage Rates of Various Gases

| Gas Type   | s.g. (based on air = 1.0) | Leakage Rate (ft³/hr) |
| :----------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Natural gas | 0.65                       | 2.5                    |
| Propane     | 1.50                       | 1.0                    |
| Butane      | 1.95                       | 0.8                    |

A.6.2.6.5 See A.6.2.6.4.

A.6.2.6.13 NFPA 86 does not address vents between safety shutoff valves, but they are sometimes installed.

A.6.2.6.13(2) See A.6.2.6.3.

A.6.2.7.3 Token relief valves only provide minimum pressure relief in cases where ambient temperatures increase the pressure inside the gas piping, which can occur during shutdown periods, or relieves small increases of pressure due to high lockup pressures that occur during a shutdown.

A.6.2.9.1 In the design, fabrication, and utilization of mixture piping, it should be recognized that the air-fuel gas mixture might be in the flammable range.

A.6.2.9.3(A) Two basic methods generally are used. One method uses a separate fire check at each burner, the other a fire check at each group of burners. The second method generally is more practical if a system consists of many closely spaced burners.

Α.6.2.9.3(E) Acceptable safety blowouts are available from some manufacturers of air-fuel mixing machines. They incorporate all the following components and design features:

(1) Flame arrester
(2) Blowout disk
(3) Provision for automatically shutting off the supply of air-gas mixture to the burners in the event of a flashback passing through an automatic fire check

A.6.2.10.7 Testing of radiant tubes should include subjecting them to thermal cycling typical for the furnace application and then verifying their ability to withstand overpressure developed by a fuel-air explosion. Overpressure testing can be done in one of two ways:

(1) Statically pressurizing the tube until it fails, then comparing this pressure to the maximum pressure (from literature) that can be developed in a contained deflagration of an optimum fuel-air mixture.

(2) Partially blocking the open end of the tube to simulate a heat exchanger, then filling the tube with a well-mixed stoichiometric fuel-air mixture (10 volumes of air to 1 volume of fuel for natural gas). The mixture is ignited at the closed end of the tube, and the pressure that develops is measured and compared to the maximum pressure (from literature) that can be developed in a contained deflagration of an optimum fuel-air mixture.

A.6.2.11.1 A burner is suitably ignited when combustion of the air-fuel mixture is established and stable at the discharge port(s) of the nozzle (s) or in the contiguous combustion tunnel.

A.6.3 In the design and use of oil-fired units, the following factors should be considered.

(1) Unlike data on fuel gases, data on many important physical/chemical characteristics are not available for fuel oil, which, being a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, is relatively unpredictable.

(2) Fuel oil has to be vaporized prior to combustion. Heat generated by the combustion commonly is utilized for this purpose, and oil remains in the vapor phase as long as sufficient temperature is present. Under these conditions, oil vapor can be treated as fuel gas.

(3) Unlike fuel gas, oil vapor condenses into liquid when the temperature falls too low and revaporizes whenever the temperature rises to an indeterminate point. Therefore, oil in a cold furnace can lead to a hazardous condition, because, unlike fuel gas, it cannot be purged. Oil can vaporize (to become a gas) when, or because, the furnace operating temperature is reached.

(4) Unlike water, for example, there is no known relationship between temperature and vapor pressure for fuel oil. For purposes of comparison, a gallon of fuel oil is equivalent to 140 ft³ (4.0 m³) of natural gas; therefore, 1 oz (0.03 kg) of fuel oil equals approximately 1 ft³ (0.03 m³) of natural gas.

There are additional considerations beyond the scope of this standard that should be given to other combustible liquids not specified in Section 6.3.

A.6.3.2 For additional information, refer to NFPA 31, *Standard for the Installation of Oil-Burning Equipment*.

A.6.3.3.4 Along circulating loop, consisting of a supply leg, a back-pressure regulating valve, and a return line back to the storage tank, is a means of reducing air entrainment.

Manual vent valves might be needed to bleed air from the high points of the oil supply piping.

A.6.3.3.6 The weight of fuel oil is always a consideration in vertical runs. When the oil is going up, pressure is lost. A gauge pressure of 100 psi (689 kPa) with a 100 ft (30.5 m) lift nets only a gauge pressure of 63 psi (434 kPa). When the oil is going down, pressure increases. A gauge pressure of 100 psi (689 kPa) with a 100 ft (30.5 m) drop nets a gauge pressure of 137 psi (945 kPa). This also occurs with fuel gas but usually is of no importance; however, it should never be overlooked with fuel oil.

A.6.3.4.1(F) Lubricated plug valves require lubrication with the proper lubricant to shut off tightly. The application and type of gas used can require frequent lubrication to maintain the ability of the valve to shut off tightly when needed.

A.6.3.4.3 Customarily, a filter or strainer is installed in the supply piping to protect the pump. However, that filter or

![NFPA logo] 2015 Edition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 78

ANNEX A
86-75

strainer mesh usually is not sufficiently fine for burner and
valve protection.

A.6.3.4.5 Under some conditions, pressure sensing on fuel
oil lines downstream from feed pumps can lead to gauge fail-
ure when rapid pulsation exists. A failure of the gauge can
result in fuel oil leakage. The gauge should be removed from
service after initial burner startup or after periodic burner
checks. An alternative approach would be to protect the gauge
during service with a pressure snubber.

A.6.3.6.1 The atomizing medium can be steam, compressed
air, low pressure air, air-gas mixture, fuel gas, or other gases.
Atomization also can be mechanical (mechanical-atomizing
tip or rotary cup).

A.6.3.8.1 A burner is suitably ignited when combustion of the
air-fuel mixture is established and stable at the discharge port(s)
of the nozzle (s) or in the contiguous combustion tunnel.

A.6.4 Oxy-fuel burners often are utilized in conjunction with
arc melting furnaces to augment electric heating. Some of
these burners utilize air as well. Stationary burners are at-
tached to the furnace shell, cover, or both. Movable burners
that normally are not attached to the furnace are suspended
from structural members outside a furnace door. These burn-
ers are manipulated from the operating floor, and the oxygen
and fuel are introduced into the furnace through long, con-
centric pipes.

Conventional flame safeguards are impractical in conjunc-
tion with oxy-fuel burners in arc furnaces because of the radio
frequency noise associated with the arcs. The electric arc is a
reliable means of ignition for the burners, once the arc has
been established. After the arc has been established, the high
temperatures inside an arc furnace cause the ignition of sig-
nificant accumulations of oxygen and fuel.

Using oxygen to augment or to substitute for combustion
air in industrial furnace heating systems presents new safety
hazards for users acquainted only with air-fuel burners.

One group of hazards arises from the exceptional reactivity
of oxygen. It is a potent oxidizer; therefore, it accelerates
burning rates. It also increases the flammability of substances
that generally are considered nonflammable in air. A fire fed
by oxygen is difficult to extinguish.

Special precautions are needed to prevent oxygen pipeline
fires, that is, fires in which the pipe itself becomes the fuel. De-
signers and installers of gaseous oxygen piping should familiarize
themselves with standards and guidelines referenced in this stan-
dard on pipe sizing, materials of construction, and sealing meth-
ods. Gaseous oxygen should flow at relatively low velocity in pipe-
lines built of ferrous materials, because friction created by
particles swept through steel pipe at a high speed can ignite a
pipeline. For that reason, copper or copper-based alloy construc-
tion is customary where the oxygen velocity needs to be high,
such as in valves, valve trim areas, and orifices.

Oxygen pipelines should be cleaned scrupulously to rid
them of oil, grease, or any hydrocarbon residues before oxy-
gen is introduced. Valves, controls, and piping elements that
come in contact with oxygen should be inspected and certi-
fied as "clean for oxygen service." Thread sealants, gaskets and
seals, and valve trim should be oxygen-compatible; otherwise,
they could initiate or promote fires. Proven cleaning and in-
spection methods are described in the Compressed Gas Asso-
ciation (CGA) publications listed in Annex M.

Furnace operators and others who install or service oxygen
piping and controls should be trained in the precautions and
safe practices for handling oxygen. For example, smoking or
striking a welding arc in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere
could start a fire. Gaseous oxygen has no odor and is invisible,
so those locations in which there is a potential for leaks are off
limits to smokers and persons doing hot work. The location of
such areas should be posted. Persons who have been in con-
tact with oxygen should be aware that their clothing is ex-
tremely flammable until it has been aired. Equipment or de-
vices that contain oxygen should never be lubricated or
cleaned with agents that are not approved for oxygen service.

Oxygen suppliers are sources of chemical material safety data
sheets (MSDS) and other precautionary information for use in
employee training. Users are urged to review the safety require-
ments in this standard and to adopt the recommendations.

Another group of hazards is created by the nature of oxy-
fuel and oxygen-enriched air flames. Because they are exceр-
tionally hot, these flames can damage burners, ruin work in
process and furnace internals, and even destroy refractory in-
sulation that was intended for air-fuel heating. Oxygen
burner systems and heating controls should have quick-acting,
reliable means for controlling heat generation.

Air that has been enriched with oxygen causes fuel to ignite
easily, because added oxygen increases the flammability range
of air-fuel mixtures. Therefore, pre-ignition purging is critical
where oxygen is used.

Oxygen is also a hazard for persons entering furnaces to
perform inspections or repairs. Strict entry procedures for
confined spaces should be implemented. They should include
analyses for excess oxygen (oxygen content in excess of
20.9 percent) in addition to the usual atmosphere tests for
oxygen deficiency and flammability.

A.6.4.3.2 CGA G-4.4, Industrial Practices for Gaseous Oxygen
Transmission and Distribution Piping Systems, specifies maximum
gas velocity criteria, materials of construction, installation
methods, joining methods, metering methods, use of filters,
and specifications for oxygen-compatible sealing materials,
gasket materials, and thread sealants.

A.6.4.3.3 See CGA G-4.1, Cleaning Equipment for Oxygen Service.

A.6.4.3.4 This requirement is intended to prevent the con-
tamination of surfaces that must be clean for oxygen service
from the oil normally present in plant compressed air.

A.6.4.3.8 See A.6.2.6.3

A.6.4.3.10 See CGA G-4.4, Industrial Practices for Gaseous Oxy-
gen Transmission and Distribution Piping Systems.

A.6.4.3.12 Commercial grade carbon steel pipe exhibits a
marked reduction in impact strength when cooled to subzero
temperatures. Consequently, it is vulnerable to impact frac-
ture if located downstream from a liquid oxygen vaporizer
running beyond its rated vaporization capacity or at very low
ambient temperatures.

A.6.4.5.2 Diffusers commonly are used to disperse oxygen
into an airstream, effecting rapid and complete mixing of the
oxygen into the air. High-velocity impingement of oxygen is a
potential fire hazard.

A.6.5.2(2) The following sample calculation is provided to
demonstrate a method of determining the required exhaust
flow moving through the collecting and venting system for
unsupervised radiant tube burners such that the atmosphere
in the collecting and venting system is less than 100 percent

2015 Edition NFPA

86-76 OVENS AND FURNACES

LFL equals noncombustible state requirement. The sample calculation is based on the following assumptions:

(1) The fuel is methane gas.
(2) All burners are not firing.
(3) All burner fuel valves are open.
(4) The main safety shutoff valve is open.

Overall, the sample calculation is based on the following conservative conditions:

(1) Use of the maximum fuel input rate for each burner
(2) Assumption that all burner fuel valves are open
(3) The design limit of <100% of LFL = noncombustible state
(4) Inclusion of the effects of elevated furnace temperature on the LFL
(5) The use of ambient air to dilute the products of combus- tions exiting the radiant tubes and being conveyed in the collecting and venting system

The effects of temperature on fuel gas LFL were obtained from Bureau of Mines Bulletin 680, "Investigation of Fire and Explosion Accidents in the Chemical, Mining, and Fuel- Related Industries — A Manual." Figure 34 in that bulletin, "Temperature effect on lower limits of flammability of 10 nor- mal paraffins in air at atmospheric pressure," shows tempera- ture (°C) versus combustibles (volume percent) and includes curves for methane, butane, and propane. It also includes a formula for computing LFL at elevated temperature. The for- mula, from Bureau of Mines Bulletin 627, "Flammability Char- acteristics of Combustible Gases and Vapors," is as follows:

$L_T = L_{25} [1-0.000721(T-25°C)]$   [A.6.5.2(2)a]

where:
$L_T$ = LFL at the desired elevated temperature $T$ (°C)
$L_{25}$ = LFL at 25°C
$T$ = Desired elevated temperature (°C)

Sample Problem — U.S. Customary Units

Objective. Calculate the exhaust flow moving through the collecting and venting system for unsupervised radiant tube burners so as to maintain the collecting and venting system atmosphere below 100% LFL (i.e., noncombustible state).

Given the following information:

(1) Furnace type: Continuous
(2) Fuel: Methane
(3) Number of burners: 10
(4) Maximum fuel input per burner: 600 scfh
(5) Furnace temperature: 1200°F
(6) Radiant tube exhaust temperature: 2000°F
(7) Collecting and venting system temperature: 500°F, or 260°C

Step 1. Determine LFL at 500°F (which will be the same as the LFL at 260°C) using the formula from above.

[A.6.5.2(2)b]

$L_{500°F} = L_{260°C} = L_{25°C} [1-0.000721(T-25°C)]$
$= 5.3[1-0.000721(260°C-25°C)]$
$= 4.4\%$ by volume

Step 2. Determine exhaust flow at 70°F to control fuel input to <100% LFL.

[A.6.5.2(2)c]

$Q_{EXH\ 70°F \& 100\% LFL} > (Q_{FUEL\ INPUT}) \cdot [(1.0)\% \text{exhaust volume}]$
$/\left[\frac{(LFL_{T\ FCE\ TEMP})}{(1.0)\% \text{fuel volume at } 100\% \text{LFL}}\right]$

$>[(600 \text{scfh/burner}) (10 \text{burners}) (1 \text{hr}/60 \text{min})] \cdot (1.0) / (0.044)(1.0) > 2.272 \text{scfm @ } 70°F$

Step 3. Determine the temperature correction factor for volume. This formula is similar to the temperature correction factor formula used in 11.6.5.1.

[A.6.5.2(2)d]

$T_{CF\ VOL} = \frac{(T_{EXH\ TEMP} + 460°F)}{(70°F + 460°F)}$
$= \frac{(500°F + 460°F)}{(70°F + 460°F)}$
$= 1.81$

Step 4. Determine exhaust flow at collection and venting system operating temperature to limit fuel input rate to 100% LFL at $T_{FCE \ TEMP}$.

[A.6.5.2(2)e]

$Q_{EXH\ 500°F \& 100\% LFL} > Q_{EXH\ 70°F \& 100\% LFL} \cdot (T_{CF\ VOL})$
$>(2272 \text{cfm @ } 70°F)(1.81)$
$> 4112 \text{cfm @ } 500°F$

Conclusion. The calculated exhaust rate of >4112 scfm @ 500°F is required to keep the collecting and venting system <100% LFL at its operating temperature with all burners off and fuel gas flowing at the maximum input rate.

Sample Problem — SI Units

Objective. Calculate the exhaust flow moving through the collecting and venting system for unsupervised radiant tube burners so as to maintain the collecting and venting system atmosphere below 100% LFL (i.e., noncombustible state).

Given the following information:

(1) Oven type: Continuous
(2) Fuel: Methane
(3) Number of burners: 10
(4) Maximum fuel input per burner: 16.99 m³/hr @ 21°C
(5) Furnace temperature: 649°C
(6) Radiant tube exhaust temperature: 1093°C
(7) Collecting and venting system temperature: 500°F (260°C)

Step 1. Determine LFL at 260°C using the formula from above:

[A.6.5.2(2)f]

$L_{500°F} = L_{260°C} = L_{25°C} [1-0.000721(T-25°C)]$
$= 5.3[1-0.000721(260°C-25°C)]$
$= 4.4\%$ by volume

Step 2. Determine exhaust airflow at 21°C to control fuel input to <100% LFL. This formula follows an approach similar to that given in Chapter 11.

[A.6.5.2(2)g]

$Q_{EXH\ 21°C \& 25\% LFL} > (Q_{FUEL\ INPUT}) \cdot [(1.0)\% \text{ exhaust vol.}]$
$/\left[\frac{(LFL_{T\ FCE\ TEMP})}{(1.0)\% \text{ fuel vol. at } 25\% \text{LFL}}\right]$

$>[(16.99 \text{m}³/\text{hr @ } 21°C/\text{burner}) (10 \text{burners}) (1 \text{hr}/60 \text{min})] \cdot (1.0)/(0.044)(1.0)$
$> 64.33 \text{ m}³/\text{min @ } 21°C$

ANNEX A                                                                                                                                                                                 86-77

Step 3. Determine the temperature correction factor for
volume. This formula is similar to the temperature correction
factor formula used in Chapter 11.
[A.6.5.2(2)h]

$T_{CF VOL} = (T_{EXH TEMP} +273°C)/(21°C+273°C)$ 
$= (260°C +273°C)/(21°C+273°C)$
$=1.81$

Step 4. Determine exhaust flow at oven operating temperature
to limit fuel input rate to 100% LFL at TFCE TEMP. This formula
follows an approach similar to that given in Chapter 11:
[A.6.5.2(2)i]

$Q_{EXH\ 260°C\ &\ 100\%\ LFL} > Q_{EXH\ 21°C\ 100\%\ LFL} (T_{CF\ VOL})$
$> (64.33\ m^3/min\ @\ 21°C)(1.81)$
$>116.63\ m^3/min\ @\ 260°C$

Conclusion. The calculated exhaust rate of >116.63 m³ @
260°C is required to keep the collecting and venting system
<100% LFL at its operating temperature with all burners off
and fuel gas flowing at the maximum input rate.

A.6.5.2(3) The designer and user are cautioned that hazard
conditions can result in common exhaust systems even when
the radiant tube burners connected to the common exhaust
system are equipped with flame supervision.

A.6.6.2 Vacuum furnaces using induction, resistance, elec-
tron beam, plasma arc, or electric arc heating systems include
an electric power supply with a high demand current. High
voltage supply used for electron beam, plasma arc, or ion dis-
charge furnace units can have unique safety considerations.

A.6.6.4.2(A) Transformers should be of the dry, high fire
point type or the less flammable liquid type. Dry transformers
should have a 270°F (150°C) rise insulation in compliance
with Section 4.03 of NEMATR 27, Commercial, Institutional and
Industrial Dry-Type Transformers.

A.6.7 Fluid heating systems are used to heat lumber dry kilns,
plywood veneer dryers, carpet ranges, textile ovens, and chemical
reaction vessels. A fluid heating system typically consists of a cen-
tral heat exchanger to heat the thermal fluid. Firing can be by
conventional gas or oil burners. The hot gases pass through a
heat exchanger to heat the thermal fluid indirectly. The heat
exchanger can be a separate, stand-alone unit or an integral part
of the heater. Conventional water-tube boilers have been used as
heaters, with thermal fluid replacing the water.

In addition to steam and water, special oils have been de-
veloped for this type of application, with flash points of several
hundred degrees Fahrenheit. For maximum thermal effi-
ciency, the oils are usually heated above their flash points,
making an oil spill especially hazardous. Also, because of the
high oil temperatures, it is usually necessary to keep the oil
circulating through the heat exchanger at all times to prevent
oil breakdown and tube fouling. Diesel-driven pumps or emer-
gency generators are usually provided for this purpose in case
of a power outage. Oil circulation can be needed for a period
of time even after burner shutdown because of residual heat in
the heater.

A.6.7.1.1 Suitable relief valves should be provided where
needed. Where relief valves are provided, they should be
piped to a safe location. See design criteria in API STD 520 P1,
Sizing, Selection, and Installation of Pressure-Relieving Devices in
Refineries, Part 1: Sizing and Selection, and API RP 520 P2, Sizing,
Selection, and Installation of Pressure-Relieving Devices in Refineries,
Part 2: Installation.

A.6.7.1.3 If a combustible heat transfer fluid is used, consid-
eration should be given to the use of automatic actuating fire-
safe isolation valves. The actuating mechanism should operate
even when it is exposed to high temperatures. Fireproofing of
the mechanism to maintain operational integrity might be
necessary.

A fire-safe valve is one that provides a relatively tight valve-seat
shutoff during temperatures that are high enough to destroy
seals. The stem packing and gasketed body joints must also be
relatively liquidtight during exposure to high temperatures.

A.7.1.1 Commissioning might be required again following
modification, reactivation, or relocation of the furnace.

A.7.1.3 Typically, inspection and leak tests of furnace piping
that conveys flammable liquids or flammable gases are per-
formed at a pressure not less than their normal operating
pressure.

A.7.1.4.1 The testing and verification of the burner manage-
ment system logic should be completed by a competent per-
son other than the system designer.

A.7.1.6 It is recommended that all system settings and param-
eters are documented for future maintenance and opera-
tional needs.

A.7.1.7 The evacuation/purging, charging, and confirma-
tion of the fuel or flammable gas supply in the piping up-
stream of the equipment isolation valve is governed by other
codes, standards, and recommended practices. One example
is Section 8.3 of NFPA 54, which establishes requirements
based upon the fuel gas pressure, pipe size, and pipe length.
Careful consideration should be given to the potential hazards
that can be created in the surrounding area for any fuel or
flammable gas discharge.

In NFPA 54, the term appliance shutoff valve is analogous to
the term equipment isolation valve in NFPA 86.

NFPA 54 does not address the use of nitrogen for an inert
purge and its property as an asphyxiant, nor does it address how
to monitor that nitrogen has displaced sufficient oxygen in the
piping system prior to the introduction of flammable gas. In this
regard, 7.3.5 of NFPA 56 is helpful in identifying the require-
ments for an oxygen detector and 7.2.2.3 is helpful for determin-
ing an adequate inert (oxygen depleted) condition.

Paragraphs 7.1.2.1 and 7.1.2.2 of NFPA 56 might also be help-
ful in engaging the involvement of the fuel gas supplier with the
evacuation and charging procedure and implementation.

A.7.2.1 The training program might include one or more of
the following components:

(1) Review of operating and maintenance information
(2) Periodic formal instruction
(3) Use of simulators
(4) Field training
(5) Other procedures
(6) Comprehension testing

The following training topics should be considered for in-
clusion when the training program is being developed:

(1) Process and equipment inspection testing
(2) Combustion of fuel-air mixtures

A.7.3.8 Examples of different modes of operations are oil vs. gas vs. other fuel; dry-out/pre-heat; auto/manual; and normal/standby.

A.7.4.5 In cases where minimal operating states, such as safety ventilation, must be established to prevent a hazardous condition, it is recommended that the precision of the set point be confirmed. When precision is inadequate, the com- ponent should be either recalibrated or replaced. Frequency of this testing and calibration should be established based on the components' mean time between failures (MTBF) data and the component manufacturer's recommendations.

A.7.4.9 The following is an example of a leak test procedure for safety shutoff valves on direct gas-fired ovens with a self- piloted burner and intermittent pilot. With the oven burn- er(s) shut off, the main shutoff valve open, and the manual shutoff valve closed, the procedures are as follows:

(1) Place the tube in test connection 1, immersed just below the surface of a container of water.

(2) Open the test connection valve. If bubbles appear, the valve is leaking, and the manufacturer's instructions should be referenced for corrective action. Energize the auxiliary power supply to safety shutoff valve No. 1 and open that valve.

(3) Place the tube in test connection 2, immersed just below the surface of a container of water.

(4) Open the test connection valve. If bubbles appear, the valve is leaking. Reference the manufacturer's instruc- tions for corrective action.

This procedure is predicated on the piping diagram shown in Figure A.7.4.9(a) and the wiring diagram shown in Figure A.7.4.9(b).

FIGURE A.7.4.9(b) Example of a Wiring Diagram for Leak Test.

It is recognized that safety shutoff valves are not entirely leak free. Because valve seats can deteriorate over time, they require periodic leak testing. Many variables are associated with the valve seat leak testing process, including gas piping and valve size, gas pressure and specific gravity, size of the burner chamber, length of downtime, and the many leakage rates published by recognized laboratories and other organi- zations.

Leakage rates are published for new valves and vary by manufacturer and the individual listings to which the manu- facturer subscribes. It is not expected that valves in service can be held to these published leakage rates, but rather that the leakage rates are comparable over a series of tests over time. Any significant deviation from the comparable leakage rates over time will indicate to the user that successive leakage tests can indicate unsafe conditions. These conditions should then be addressed by the user in a timely manner.

The location of the manual shutoff valve downstream of the safety shutoff valve affects the volume downstream of the safety shutoff valve and is an important factor in determining when to start counting bubbles during a safety shutoff valve seat leakage test. The greater the volume downstream of the safety shutoff valve, the longer it will take to fully charge the trapped volume in the pipe between the safety shutoff valve and the manual shutoff valve. This trapped volume needs to be fully charged before starting the leak test.

Care should be exercised when performing the safety shut- off valve seat leakage test, because flammable gases will be released into the local environment at some indeterminate pressure. Particular attention should be paid to lubricated plug valves used as manual shutoff valves to ensure that they have been properly serviced prior to the valve seat leakage test.

The publications listed in Annex M include examples, al- though not all inclusive, of acceptable leakage rate method- ologies that the user can employ.

Figure A.7.4.9 (a) through Figure A.7.4.9 (c) show examples of gas piping and wiring diagrams for leak testing.

Example. The following example is predicated on the pip- ing diagram shown in Figure A.7.4.9(a) and the wiring dia- gram shown in Figure A.7.4.9(b).

FIGURE A.7.4.9(c) Leak Test for a Safety Shutoff Valve.

With the oven burner(s) shut off, the equipment isolation
valve open, and the manual shutoff valve located downstream
of the second safety shutoff valve closed, the procedures are as
follows:

(1) Connect the tube to leak test valve No. 1.

(2) Bleed trapped gas by opening leak test valve No. 1.

(3) Immerse the tube in water as shown in Figure A.7.4.9(c). If
bubbles appear, the valve is leaking. Reference the manufac-
turer's instructions for corrective action. Examples of ac-
ceptable leakage rates are given in Table A.7.4.9(a).

(4) Apply auxiliary power to safety shutoff valve No. 1. Close leak
test valve No. 1. Connect the tube to leak test valve No. 2 and
immerse it in water as shown in Figure A.7.4.9(c).

(5) Open leak test valve No. 2. If bubbles appear, the valve is
leaking. Reference the manufacturer's instructions for
corrective action. Examples of acceptable leakage rates
are given in Table A.7.4.9(a).

$$L= \frac{|\Delta p| \times V_{test} \times 3600}{P_{atm} \times T_{test}}$$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         [A.7.4.9]

where:

$L$ = leakage rate (cm³/hr)

$|\Delta p|$ = absolute value of initial test pressure (mbar) –
final test pressure (mbar)

$V_{test}$ = total volume of the test (cm³)

$P_{atm}$ = atmospheric pressure (atmospheres)

$T_{test}$ = test time (seconds)

Conversion factors

1 in. water col. = 2.44 mbar

1 psi = 27.7 in. water col.

1 atmosphere = 14.7 psi

This test method can be done by tapping into the following
ports and performing the test method in Table A.7.4.9(b).

Table A.7.4.9(b) Test Methods.

| Test Port Location | Test Method | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A test port between both safety shutoff valves | Pressure decay on $V_2$ |
| A test port downstream of both safety shutoff valves | Pressure rise on $V_1$ |
|   | Pressure rise on $V_1$ and $V_2$ (requires manual shutoff valve downstream both safety shutoff valves and that it be leak tightness tested). |
| A test port upstream of both valves | Pressure decay on $V_1$ and $V_2$ (requires a leak tightness test on the upstream, manual isolation valve) |

A.7.4.10.2 Where a means is not provided to count the actual
number of safety shutoff valve cycles, it becomes a mainte-
nance responsibility to maintain an estimate of safety shutoff
valve cycles so that the safety shutoff valve is replaced before it
exceeds 90 percent of the life cycles established by the safety
shutoff valve manufacturer.

A.7.4.12 Lubricated plug valves require lubrication with the
proper lubricant in order to shut off tightly. The application
and type of gas used can require frequent lubrication to main-
tain the ability of the valve to shut off tightly when needed.

A.7.4.13 Exercising the valve means that the valve is operated
but not necessarily through the full range.

A.7.4.15 The intent is to verify that the temperature indicator
of the excess temperature controller is reading correctly.

A.7.4.19 See A.6.2.6.3.

A.7.6 Procedures for confined space entry can be found in
29 CFR 1910.146, "Permit-Required Confined Spaces," and
ANSI Z117.1, *Safety Requirements for Confined Spaces*. Informa-
tion on hazards of chemicals can be found in *NIOSH Pocket*
*Guide to Chemical Hazards*.

A.8.1 For the protection of personnel and property, consid-
eration should be given to the supervision and monitoring of
conditions that could cause or that could lead to a potential
hazard on any installation.

A.8.2.1 A flame rod is not required to be listed.

A.8.2.2 The AHJ should consider reliability and durability
during the selection process when approving a device.

A.8.2.3 Consideration should be given to the effects of radi-
ant heat on the safety devices. Radiant heat can cause safety
devices to be exposed to temperatures greater than their rat-
ings. Adequate insulation, heat shields, ventilation, or other
measures should be used in cases where radiant heat causes
safety devices to reach temperatures above their ratings.

A.8.2.9 The actions resulting from a manual emergency
switch action take into account the individual system design
and the hazards (e.g., mechanical, combustion system, special
atmosphere, etc.) associated with changing the existing state
to another state and initiates actions to cause the system to
revert to a safe condition.

For some applications, additional manual action may be
required to bring the process to a safe condition.

A.8.2.10 The manual intervention applies only to shutdowns of
a safety function. Safety devices such as burner safeguard control-
lers can contain non-safety-related control sequences that can
shut down the heating system due to a process control function,
such as temperature control. Even though the action is within a
safety device, the shutdown is not by a safety function.

A.8.2.11 A single pressure transmitter with associated logic
can be used to provide both of the required low and high
pressure interlock functions. A single flow transmitter with as-
sociated logic can be used to provide both of the required low
and high flow interlock functions.

A.8.3 Furnace controls that meet the performance-based re-
quirements of standards such as ANSI/ISA 84.00.01, *Applica-* 
*tion of Safety Instrumented Systems for the Process Industries*, and
IEC 61511, *Functional Safety: Safety Instruments Systems for the*
*Process Industry Sector*, can be considered equivalent. The deter-
mination of equivalency will involve complete conformance to
the safety life cycle including risk analysis, safety integrity level
selection, and safety integrity level verification, which should
be submitted to the authority having jurisdiction.

Α.8.3.1.4 The control circuit and its non-furnace-mounted
or furnace-mounted control and safety components should be
housed in a dusttight panel or cabinet, protected by partitions
or secondary barriers, or separated by sufficient spacing from
electrical controls employed in the higher voltage furnace
power system. Related instruments might or might not be in-
stalled in the same control cabinet. The door providing access
to this control enclosure might include means for mechanical
interlock with the main disconnect device required in the fur-
nace power supply circuit.

Temperatures within this control enclosure should be lim-
ited to 125°F (52°C) for suitable operation of plastic compo-
nents, thermal elements, fuses, and various mechanisms that
are employed in the control circuit.

A.8.4 The PLC approach to combustion interlocks-
multiburner is as follows:

(1) Interlocks relating to purge are done via PLC.

(2) The purge timer is implemented in PLC.

(3) Interlocks relating to combustion air and gas pressure are
done via PLC.

(4) Gas valves for pilots and burners directly connected to flame
safeguards must conform to the requirements of 8.8.2.

(5) Operation of pilot and burner gas valves must be con-
firmed by the PLC.

(6) A PLC can be set up as intermittent, interrupted, or con-
stant pilot operation. With an appropriate flame safe-
guard, it would be possible to provide an interrupted pilot
with one flame sensor and one flame safeguard.

A.8.4.2 Compliance with the manufacturer's safety manual
would achieve actions such as, but not limited to, the PLC
detecting the following:

(1) Failure to execute any program or task containing safety
logic

(2) Failure to communicate with any safety I/O

(3) Changes in software set points of safety functions

(4) Failure of outputs related to safety functions

(5) Failure of timing related to safety functions

An SIL 3-capable PLC includes third-party certification,
the actions above, and partitioning to separate safety logic
from process logic.

The requirements for SIL capability in 8.4.2 pertain only to
the PLC and its I/O and not to the implementation of the
burner management system. The purpose of the SIL capability
requirement is to provide control reliability.

A.8.4.4 The burner management system logic, memory, and
I/O should be characterized by the following:

(1) Independent from nonsafety logic and memory

(2) Protected from alteration by non-BMS logic or memory
access

(3) Protected from alteration by unauthorized users

Α.8.4.4(A) (4) This standard requires that the signal from the
safety device be directly transmitted to the safety PLC input.
Once the safety PLC processes the signal the resulting data
can be used for any purpose.

A.8.5.1.1 Procedures for admitting and withdrawing flammable
special processing atmospheres are covered in Chapter 13.

In some applications, purging with the furnace doors open
could force combustible or indeterminate gases into the work
area and the area surrounding the furnace, thereby creating a
potential hazard to those areas. Purging with the doors closed
ensures that furnace gases exit out of the furnace through the
intended flue or exhaust system.

Igniting the furnace burners with the furnace doors open is
an effective way to avoid containment during the ignition cycle.

A.8.5.1.2 Equipment that is not explosion resistant, has no
combustion air blower or exhaust blower, and relies on a natu-
ral draft to meet the purge requirements of this 8.5.1.2, should
address the following conditions to ensure conformance:

(1) The natural draft flow rate can be affected by furnace
doors, covers, and dampers. If the purge rate and timing
depend on the setting of these devices, they should be
interlocked to meet the requirements in 8.5.1.2(C) (1),
8.5.1.2(D), and 8.5.1.2(E).
(2) The proof of minimum required purge flow should
handle cases in which the natural draft flow rate can be
affected by differences in pressure between the heating
chamber and the inside or outside of the building.
(3) The specific gravity of the fuel must be considered in the
design of the furnace purge path. For example, there
should be no collection areas at the bottom of the heating
chamber with a heavier-than-air fuel gas.
(4) If the purge flow rate is not known or is not directly
proved, then the purge time to be set in the timer should
be determined by measurement. The party commission-
ing the burner system is responsible for this measurement
and the documentation. The measurement should be
conducted at the time when the furnace is at normal am-
bient temperature and is at its lowest purge flow rate. Con-
firming calculations and measurement data should be
available for review in accordance with Chapter 7. Com-
bustible gas analyzers and oxygen analyzers should be
used to measure the time from the end of unburned gas
release for the trial-for-ignition period until the combus-
tible concentration of the system volume is below 25 per-
cent LFL. The test should be repeated immediately for a
second release of gas and time delay to ensure that the
measurement is still below 25 percent LFL. If it is not,
then the purge time must be increased, with repeated
purge and trial-for-ignition sequences, until there is no
successive buildup of the combustible concentration.

A.8.5.1.2(C) (1) Equipment such as thermal oxidizers com-
monly process sources of contaminated air. Contaminated air
is an indeterminate purge medium. Design of the pre-ignition
airflow interlocks should incorporate a means to prove a
source of fresh air and also prove the isolation of contami-
nated air sources during pre-ignition purge. In complex sys-
tems involving multiple sources where it is not always possible
to shut down all indeterminate sources, providing a fresh air
source and positive isolation from all contaminated sources is
necessary to ensure proper pre-ignition purging.

A.8.5.1.2(C) (2) See Figure A.8.5.1.2 (C) (2)

A.8.5.1.8 The following sections of this standard continue to
apply where the provisions of 8.5.1.8 are applied:

(1) The combustion air safety device requirements of Sec-
tion 8.7.
(2) Each burner and pilot is supervised by a combustion safe-
guard in accordance with Section 8.10.
(3) Each burner system is equipped with safety shutoff valves
in accordance with Section 8.8.

A.8.5.1.8(2)(a) Consideration should be given to the proximity
of operating burners when the common combustion chamber
exception to repeating purges is utilized. Accumulation of local-
ized vapors or atmospheres is possible even with an operating
burner in a chamber, depending on the size of the chamber, the
number of burners, and the proximity of operating burners to

> [Figure] Diagram of a multiple burner system with independently operated burners using a common safety shutoff valve (SSOV) with single proved closed interlock for pre-purge.  The diagram shows a common safety shutoff valve connected to a gas line. A leak test valve is located downstream of the common safety shutoff valve. The gas line splits into three separate lines, each leading to a burner. Each burner line has two individual burner safety shutoff valves in series, followed by a manual shutoff valve before reaching the burner. Leak test valves are installed downstream of the individual burner safety shutoff valves.  The burners are labeled as "To burner 1", "To burner 2", and "To burner 3". Additional burners can be connected using the "To other burners" connection.  A note indicates that a proof of closure switch is present and a valve proving system is optional.  Another note indicates position indication for individual burner inputs, with an exception for inputs under 150,000 Btu/h.


the accumulation. In addition to proximity, burner design and
exposure of the flame may also impact the ability of the operating
burner to mitigate vapor or gaseous accumulations.

A.8.5.1.8(3) The following sample calculation is provided to
demonstrate a method of determining the 25 percent LFL
requirement. The calculation is based on the following as-
sumptions:

(1) The fuel is methane gas.
(2) All burners are off, and all safety shutoff valves are de-
energized.
(3) All burner safety shutoff valves fail to function and remain
full open during the period that the burners are off.
(4) Safety shutoff valve leakage is equal to the maximum
burner fuel input rate.

Overall, the sample calculation is based on the following
conservative conditions:

(1) The use of the maximum fuel input rate for each burner
(2) Failure of all burner safety shutoff valves fail to close
(3) Design limit of 25 percent of LFL
(4) Inclusion of the effects of elevated furnace temperature
on the LFL

The effects of temperature on fuel gas LFL were obtained
from Bureau of Mines Bulletin 680, "Investigation of Fire and
Explosion Accidents in the Chemical, Mining, and Fuel-
Related Industries — A Manual." Figure 34 in that bulletin,
"Temperature effect on lower limits of flammability of 10 nor-
mal paraffins in air at atmospheric pressure," shows tempera-
ture (°C) versus combustibles (volume percent) and includes
curves for methane, butane, and propane. It also includes a

(4) All safety shutoff valves are tested for seat leakage at least
semiannually.
(5) Safety shutoff valve seat leakage is assumed to be 1 scfh
(0.0283 m³/hr @ 21°C).
The following thoughts are offered regarding the selection
of the 1 scfh (0.0283 m³/hr @ 21°C) safety shutoff valve seat
leakage rate.
Limited data reviewed by the committee indicate that valve
seat leakage rates over 1 scfh (0.0283 m³/hr @ 21°C) are not
anticipated unless the safety shutoff valve seats are exposed to
extremely unusual conditions such as corrosives in the fuel gas
or furnace heat allowed to back up the fuel line and burn the
safety shutoff valve seat. The former condition is the basis for
limiting the use of 8.5.1.8(4) to furnaces using natural gas,
butane, or propane fuel gases. The latter condition occurred
in a case where a fuel line was inappropriately opened by
maintenance staff while the furnace was in operation. The fur-
nace was promptly shut down, and the safety shutoff valves
were replaced.
Under operating conditions expected by this standard, it is
anticipated that debris from internal fuel gas line oxidation
(rust), pipe thread shavings not removed before fuel line assem-
bly, or similar exposures can subject one safety shutoff valve to
seat damage that can lead to seat leakage of one safety shutoff
valve; however, it is not expected that both safety shutoff valves
would experience similar seat leakage. The selected safety shutoff
valve seat leakage rate of 1 scfh (0.0283 m³/hr @ 21°C) is consid-
ered conservative.
Overall, this sample calculation is based upon the following
conservative conditions:
(1) Using a safety shutoff valve seat leakage rate of 1 scfh
(0.0283 m³/hr @ 21°C)
(2) Providing two safety shutoff valves for each fuel path
(3) Closing two valves or using proof of closure if closing one
valve
(4) Assuming safety shutoff valve leakage at each burner fuel
path
(5) Using a design limit of 25 percent of LFL
(6) Including the effects of elevated furnace temperature on
the LFL
(7) Assuming no fuel exits the furnace
The effects of temperature on fuel gas LFL were obtained
from Bureau of Mines Bulletin 680, "Investigation of Fire and
Explosion Accidents in the Chemical, Mining, and Fuel-Related
Industries -A Manual." Figure 34 in that bulletin, "Temperature
effect on lower limits of flammability of 10 normal paraffins in air
at atmospheric pressure," shows temperature (°C) versus com-
bustibles (volume percent) and includes curves for methane, bu-
tane, and propane. It also includes a formula for computing LFL
at elevated temperature. That formula, based on Bureau of
Mines Bulletin 627, "Flammability Characteristics of Combus-
tible Gases and Vapors," is as follows:

[A.8.5.1.8(4) (d)]

$L_T = L_{25} [1-0.000721(T-25°C)]$

where:
$L_T$ = LFL at the desired elevated temperature, T (°C)
$L_{25}$ = LFL at 25°C
T = Desired elevated temperature (°C)

Sample Problem — U. S. Customary Units
Objective. Calculate the amount of time that all burners can
be turned off before the furnace atmosphere will reach 25 per-
cent LFL.

Assumptions. Furnace contains no combustibles when the
burners are turned off. Furnace is under positive pressure with
no air infiltration.
Given the following information:
Furnace type: Batch
Furnace size: 8 ft wide × 6 ft deep × 8 ft tall
Number of burners: 5
Burner design rate: 0.8 MM Btu/hr
Burner design excess air: 10.0%
Burner design air capacity: 8800 scfh
Burner air minimum design flow: 100 scfh
Maximum leak rate each flow path*: 1 scfh
Number of burner flow paths**: 5
Furnace temperature: 900°F (482°C)
Oxygen in furnace atmosphere: 18%
Fuel: Methane
*The flow path is across one set of closed safety shutoff
valves.
**The number of flow paths is the number of sets of safety
shutoff valves that are closed that can leak into the furnace
enclosure.

Step 1. Determine LFL at 900°F using the formula from
above:

$L_{900°F} = L_{482°C} = L_{25°C} [1-0.000721(T-25°C)]$
$= 5.3[1-0.000721(482°C -25°C)]$
$= 3.6\% by volume$

Step 2. Determine the furnace volume:

$V_{FCE} = L×W×H = 8 ft×6 ft×8 ft = 384 ft³$

Step 3. Determine the methane leak rate into the furnace
with all burners off:

$Q_{LEAK}$ = # flow paths × leak rate per path
= 5 paths x1 scfh/path
= 5 scfh

Step 4. Determine the airflow into the furnace with all burn-
ers off:

$Q_{AIR}$ = #burners × airflow rate per idle burner
= 5 burners×100 scfh/burner
= 500 scfh

Step 5. Determine the percent volume methane to air
through all burners:

% volume methane to air = $(Q_{LEAK}/Q_{AIR})(100\%)$
= (5 scfh/500 scfh)(100%)
=1%

Step 6. Determine the percent LFL resulting from the meth-
ane flow through all burner fuel paths at 900°F:

$%LFL_{900°F}$ = (% volume methane to air/$LFL_{900°F}$)(100%)
= (1%/3.5%)(100%)
= 28.57%

Step 7. Determine the time in minutes to reach 25 percent
LFL with all burners off:

$t_{FCE \% 25\% LFL} =[(L_{900°F}) (0.25)]/[(Q_{LEAK}/V_{FCE})](60 min/hr)$
$= [(0.036)(0.25)/(5 ft³/hr/384 ft³)] (60 min/hr)
= 41.5 minutes

Conclusions. Where the value of percent $LFL_{900°F}$ exceeds
25 percent, the burner safety shutoff valves can remain closed

a repurge of the furnace is required.

Where the value of percent $LFL_{900°F}$ equals or is less than
25 percent, burners can be reignited at any time as long as the
airflow rate $Q_{AIR}$ is proven and interlocked in the burner man-
agement system such that loss of this proven airflow rate will
require a repurge of the furnace before burner reignition is
permitted.

Sample Problem — SI Units

*Objective*. Calculate the amount of time that all burners can
be turned off before the furnace atmosphere will reach 25 per-
cent LFL.

*Assumptions*. Furnace contains no combustibles when the
burners are turned off. Furnace is under positive pressure with
no air infiltration.

Given the following information:

Furnace type: Batch

Furnace size: 2.438 m wide x 1.828 m deep × 2.428 m tall

Number of burners: 5

Burner design rate: 234.2 kW

Burner design excess air: 10.0 percent

Burner design air capacity: 249.2 m³/hr @ 21°C

Burner air minimum design flow: 2.83 m³/hr @ 21°C

Maximum leak rate each flow path*: 0.0283 m³/hr @ 21°C

Number of burner flow paths**: 5

Furnace temperature: 482°C (900°F)

Oxygen in furnace atmosphere: 18 percent

Fuel: Methane

*The flow path is across one set of closed safety shutoff
valves.

**The number of flow paths is the number of sets of safety
shutoff valves that are closed that can leak into the furnace
enclosure.

*Step 1*. Determine LFL at 482°C using the formula from
above:

$L_{482°C} = L_{25} [1-0.000721(T-25°C)]$

$ = 5.3(1-0.000721)(482°C -25°C)$

$ = 3.6\% 
by volume$

*Step 2*. Determine the furnace volume:

$V_{FCE}=L×W×H = 2.438 m×1.828 m×2.428 m = 10.87 m³$

*Step 3*. Determine the methane leak rate into the furnace
with all burners off:

$Q_{LEAK}$ = #flow paths × leak rate per path

$ = 5 paths×0.0283 m³/hr @ 21°C/path$

$ = 0.142 m³/hr @ 21°C$

*Step 4*. Determine the airflow into the furnace with all burn-
ers off:

$Q_{AIR}$ = # burners × airflow rate per idle burner

$ = 5 burners×2.83 m³/hr @ 21°C/burner$

$ = 14.2 m³/hr @ 21°C$

*Step 5*. Determine the percent volume methane to air
through all burners:

% vol. methane to air

$=(Q_{LEAK} / Q_{AIR}) (100\%)$

$ = (0.142 m³/hr @ 21°C/14.2 m³/hr @ 21°C)100\%$

$=1\%$

*Step 6*. Determine the percent LFL resulting from the meth-
ane flow through all burner fuel paths at 482°C:

$%LFL_{482°C}$ = (% volume methane to air/$LFL_{482°c}$) (100%)

$=(1\%/3.5\%)(100\%)$

$= 28.57\%$

*Step 7*. Determine the time in minutes to reach 25 percent
LFL with all burners off:

$_{FCE}$ 25% LFL. = $[(L_{482°C}) (0.25)] / [(Q_{LEAK}/V_{FCE})] (60 min/hr)$

$ = [(0.036)(0.25) / (0.142 m³/hr) (10.87m³)](60 min/hr)$

$ = 41.3 minutes$

*Conclusions*. Where the value of percent $LFL_{482°C}$ exceeds
25 percent, the burner safety shutoff valves can remain closed
and burners be reignited without a repurge within a period of
time not exceeding $_{FCE}$ 25% LFL. After $_{FCE}$ 25% LFL is exceeded,
a repurge of the furnace is required.

Where the value of percent $LFL_{482°C}$ equals or is less than
25 percent, burners can be reignited at any time as long as the
airflow rate $Q_{AIR}$ is proven and interlocked in the burner man-
agement system such that loss of this proven airflow rate will
require a repurge of the furnace before burner reignition is
permitted.

A.8.5.2 When the purge is complete, there should be a limit
to the time between purge complete and trial for ignition.
Delay can result in the need for a repurge.

A.8.6.1 Use of a rotational switch is an acceptable means of
proving operation of a fan where the impeller is not located in a
dedicated housing (nonducted). A Hall effect sensor is one ex-
ample of a device that can be used to prove fan shaft rotation.
Regular inspection of the impeller may be required to en-
sure original performance is maintained (i.e., blades still at-
tached, angles on blades correct, etc.).

A.8.7.4 In industrial combustion applications with modulat-
ing flow control valves downstream of the combustion air
blower, it is most common to interlock the constant combus-
tion air source pressure on single and multiburner systems to
meet the requirements of 8.7.2 and 8.7.4.

Because the combustion airflow is proved during each
purge cycle along with the combustion air source pressure, the
most common convention is to prove the combustion air
source pressure during burner operation following purge. In
a multiburner system, the proof of combustion airflow during
purge proves that any manual valves in the combustion air
system are in an adequately open position. These manual air
valves are provided for maintenance and combustion airflow
balancing among burners in a temperature control zone. In
combustion air supply systems that use either an inlet damper
or a speed control, the combustion air pressure can fall below
reliably repeatable levels with listed pressure switch interlocks
at low fire. For these systems, the proof of minimum airflow
can be a more reliable interlock.

A pressure switch on the inlet (suction) side of an induced
draft (ID) fan can be used to prove that the minimum re-
quired suction pressure is available.

For combustion systems that use high pressure gas/air to
induce (inspirate) air locally at each burner, it is impractical to
monitor and prove the availability of combustion air.
For combustion systems that use natural (stack) draft to in-
duce air into the burners or combustion chamber, it is impracti-
cal to monitor and prove the availability of combustion air.

A.8.7.5 The maximum safe operating pressure can be ex-
ceeded where compressed air is utilized.

A.8.8.1.3 Paragraph 8.8.1.3 addresses conditions under
which only one safety shutoff valve is to close to isolate a
burner from its fuel gas supply. Figure A.8.8.1.3 provides a
summary of 8.8.1.3 in the form of a decision tree. See 8.5.1.7
and 8.5.1.8 for guidance regarding conditions that are needed
to allow that burner to be placed back in service. The require-
ments of 8.5.1.8 might not allow a burner shut off by closing a
single safety shutoff valve to be placed back in service without
repeating a pre-ignition purge.

The requirements of 8.8.1.3 do not preclude opening of
the safety shutoff valve located upstream of the individual
burners using single safety shutoff valves during the trial for
ignition for the first burner being lighted.

A.8.8.1.3(2) See A.8.5.1.8(3) for a sample calculation to demon-
strate a method of determining the 25 percent LFL requirement.

A.8.8.1.10 Backpressure can lift a valve from its seat, permit-
ting furnace gases to enter the fuel system. Examples of situa-
tions that create backpressure conditions are leak testing, fur-
nace backpressure, combustion air pressure during prepurge,
and fluidized bed furnaces.

A.8.8.2.2 An additional safety shutoff valve located to be com-
mon to the furnace system and proved closed and interlocked
with the pre-ignition purge circuit can be used to meet the
requirements of 8.8.2.2.

FIGURE A.8.8.1.3 Safety Shutoff Decision Tree.

A.8.8.3.2 An additional safety shutoff valve located to be com-
mon to the furnace system and proved closed and interlocked
with the pre-ignition purge circuit can be used to meet the
requirements of 8.8.3.2.

A.8.9 A system designer can choose not to use pressure
switches in a pilot. However, gas pressure switches on a pilot
can be desirable, and the following conditions should be con-
sidered in deciding whether or not switches should be used:

(1) If it is a continuous pilot. If a reliable pilot after light off is
still a desirable part of the safety during operation of the
burner, the switches help prove the reliability of the pilot
so that the gas pressure to the pilot is proven to be within
designed parameters.

(2) If the pilot burner capacity is above 400,000 Btu/hr. Direct
sparking a burner in excess of 400,000 Btu/hr could in-
troduce added risks if a delayed ignition occurs due to too
much or too little gas pressure.

(3) If the pilot burner uses its own pressure regulator. Failure of that
regulator could cause instability of the burner or expose
downstream components to pressures exceeding their
ratings.

(4) If the inlet pressure to the pilot regulator exceeds 1/2 psi. The
higher the pressure to the pilot burner, the greater the
risk of a problem due to incorrect gas pressure. The fail-
ure or overloading of a pilot regulator can be at a signifi-
cantly higher risk where inlet pressures to the pilot regu-
lator exceed 12 psi.

(5) Where providing overpressure protection for a pilot line in
order to comply with 6.2.7, a high gas pressure switch on the
pilot line in combination with a shutoff valve can be used.

A.8.10.1 Subsections 8.2.2 and 8.2.5 require that the flame
detector and the combustion safeguard be applied and in-
stalled according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where
flame detectors (scanners) with combustion safeguards con-
tinuously operate without a shutdown beyond the maximum
interval recommended by the combustion safeguard and
flame detector manufacturer's instructions, such continuous
operation without a shutdown and safe-start check would not
be compliant.

Ultraviolet sensors can fail in such a manner that the loss of
flame is not detected. Where these sensors are placed in con-
tinuous service, failures can be detected by a self-checking ul-
traviolet detector or by periodic testing of the detector for
proper operation.

A.8.10.3 Figure A.8.10.3 (not to scale) is a diagram showing
sequences that need to occur to achieve a safety shutoff valve
(SSOV) closing time of not more than 5 seconds following loss of
flame. Typical SSOVs have a maximum closing time of 1 second;
however, some listed or approved valves can have longer times.

A.8.12 Wherever the temperature of fuel oil can drop below a
safe level, the increased viscosity prevents proper atomization.
No. 2 and No. 4 fuel oils can congeal if their temperature falls
below their pour point, whether or not preheaters are used.
Wherever the temperature of the fuel oil rises above a safe
level, vaporization of the oil takes place before atomization
and causes a reduction in fuel volume severe enough to create
substantial quenching of the flame.

A.8.13.1 The fact that oil or gas is considered a standby fuel
should not reduce the safety requirements for that fuel.

A.8.16 The excess temperature set point should be set no
higher than the maximum temperature specified by the manu-
facturer. If flammable or combustible materials are being pro-
cessed in an oven or a dryer, the set point should be a tempera-
ture that will not allow the material to reach its auto-ignition
temperature. Set point limits based on auto-ignition temperature
do not apply to special-atmosphere furnaces and fume incinera-
tors. If, for process reasons, the work must be protected from
reaching an elevated temperature that is lower than the oven
excess temperature set point, an additional temperature limit in-
terlock can be used, or the operating temperature controller can
be interlocked or alarmed as needed for this purpose.

For a constant speed exhaust fan, as the oven temperature
increases, the oven exhaust flow in standard cubic feet per
minute decreases. A high temperature excursion reduces safety
ventilation and could cause a flammable vapor explosion in ov-
ens and dryers provided with safety ventilation.

A.8.18.2.7 The sensing element should be positioned where
the difference between the temperature control sensor and
the excess temperature limit sensor is minimized. The
temperature-sensing element of the excess temperature limit
interlock should be located where it will sense the excess tem-
perature condition that will cause the first damage to the fur-
nace or work as temperatures within the furnace rise above the
maximum operating set point most critical to safe operation.

A.8.18.2.8 The temperature-sensing element of the excess
temperature limit interlock can be monitored by other instru-
mentation, provided that the accuracy of the excess tempera-
ture limit interlock temperature reading is not diminished.

A.8.19 The excess temperature set point should be set no
higher than the maximum temperature specified by the
manufacturer. If flammable or combustible materials are be-
ing processed in an oven or a dryer, the set point should be a
temperature that will not allow the material to reach its auto-
ignition temperature. Set point limits based on auto-ignition
temperature do not apply to special-atmosphere furnaces and
fume incinerators. If, for process reasons, the work must be
protected from reaching an elevated temperature that is lower
than the oven excess temperature set point, an additional tem-
perature limit interlock can be used, or the operating tem-
perature controller can be interlocked or alarmed as needed
for this purpose.

For a constant speed exhaust fan, as the oven temperature
increases, the oven exhaust flow in standard cubic feet per
minute decreases. A high temperature excursion reduces
safety ventilation and could cause a flammable vapor explo-
sion in ovens and dryers provided with safety ventilation.

A.8.19.2 Interrupting the flow of heat transfer fluid to an
oven can be accomplished by shutting down the central fluid
heating system or by shutting a heat transfer fluid safety shut-
off valve on both the oven supply and the return lines. If heat
transfer fluid safety shutoff valves are used, the central fluid
heating system might need an automatic emergency loop to
provide a dummy cooling load and to maintain fluid flow
through the heater.

A.8.19.6 To detect other sensor failures, such as thermocouple
short circuits, that will not result in the action required by 8.19.5,
the operator or maintenance personnel can evaluate the excess
temperature limit interlock's temperature indication.

A.8.19.7 Temperature-sensing components, such as thermo-
couple and extension wires, that are not rated for the environ-
ment are at greater risk of short circuits.

A.8.19.8 The sensing element should be positioned where
the difference between the temperature control sensor and
the excess temperature limit sensor is minimized. The
temperature-sensing element of the excess temperature limit
interlock should be located where it will sense the excess tem-
perature condition that will cause the first damage to the fur-
nace or work as temperatures within the furnace rise above the
maximum operating set point most critical to safe operation.

A.8.19.9 The temperature-sensing element of the excess tem-
perature limit interlock may be monitored by other instru-
mentation, providing that accuracy of the excess temperature
limit interlock temperature reading is not diminished.

A.9.1 This standard addresses the protection needs of ovens,
furnaces, and related equipment. Fire protection needs exter-
nal to this equipment are beyond the scope of this standard.

Fixed fire protection for the equipment can consist of
sprinklers, water spray, carbon dioxide, foam, dry chemical,
water mist, or steam extinguishing systems. The extent of pro-
tection required depends upon the construction and arrange-
ment of the oven, furnace, or related equipment as well as the
materials being processed. Fixed protection should extend as
far as necessary in the enclosure and ductwork if combustible
material is processed or combustible buildup is likely to occur.
If the fixtures or racks are combustible or are subject to load-
ing with excess combustible finishing materials, or if an appre-
ciable amount of combustible drippings from finishing mate-
rials accumulates in the oven or ductwork, protection should
also be provided.

Steam inerting systems can be used to protect ovens where
steam flooding is the only means available. Otherwise, the use
of steam in ovens is not recommended.

Hydrogen and other flammable gas fires are not normally
extinguished until the supply of gas has been shut off because
of the danger of re-ignition or explosion. Personnel should be
cationed that hydrogen flames are invisible and do not radi-
ate heat. In the event of fire, large quantities of water should
be sprayed on adjacent equipment to cool the equipment and
prevent its involvement in the fire. Combination fog and solid
stream nozzles should be used to allow the widest adaptability
in fire control.

Small flammable gas fires can be extinguished by dry
chemical extinguishers or with carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or
steam. Re-ignition can occur if a metal surface adjacent to the
flame is not cooled with water or by other means.

Dip tanks and drain boards included in oven enclosures
should be protected by an automatic fire suppression system if
flammable or combustible liquids are involved. NFPA 34, Stan-
dard for *Dipping, Coating, and Printing Processes Using Flammable*
or *Combustible Liquids*, provides guidance for the design of fire
suppression systems for dip tanks and drain boards.

A.9.1.3 Where fire protection is determined to be necessary,
a documented study should be conducted to determine the
correct response to a fire to achieve a safe shutdown of the
oven and an effective response of the fire protection system.
Automatic interlocks should be provided where actions do not
require operator evaluation. Specific actions will depend on
the oven design, type of fire protection system, the character-
istics of the combustible material(s), the source (s) of combus-
tibles, the ability to isolate combustible sources, and the effects
of fresh air. Items to be considered should include, but not be
limited to, the following:

(1) The means for detecting a fire

(2) Type(s) of fire protection system(s) effective at control-
ling the fire

(3) Manual vs. automatic operation of the fire protection system

(4) Shutting down the fuel supply (heating system) where
such action does not increase the fire hazard

(5) Stopping the conveyor system vs. diverting or stopping
entering product and running the conveyor at high speed
to empty oven

(6) Shutting down fans and closing dampers to block fresh air
entry and contain the fire suppression medium vs. main-
taining fans in operations and dampers open to ensure an
explosive atmosphere does not develop

A.9.2 Where steam extinguishing systems are provided, they
should be designed in accordance with fire protection engi-
neering principles.

ANNEX A                                                                                                                                                                                                            86-89

A.9.2.1 Automatic sprinkler protection should be considered
for ovens, furnaces, or related equipment if any of the follow-
ing conditions exists:

(1) The material being processed is combustible.
(2) Racks, trays, spacers, or containers are combustible.
(3) There are areas where appreciable accumulations of com-
bustible drippings or deposits are present on the inside of
the oven surface or on racks, trays, and so forth.

The type of sprinklers and their arrangement should be
appropriate to the oven arrangement, interior ductwork, and
the material passing through the oven.

A.9.2.3 Where a water spray system is protecting a quench
tank, the fixed-temperature actuation devices for the water
spray system should be rated at least one temperature rating
lower than the temperature rating of the building sprinklers
over the quench tanks.

A.9.2.4 Where a carbon dioxide system is protecting a
quench tank, the fixed-temperature actuation devices for the
carbon dioxide system should be rated at least one tempera-
ture rating lower than the temperature rating of the building
sprinklers over the quench tanks.

A.9.2.6 Where a dry chemical system is protecting a quench
tank, the fixed-temperature actuation devices for the dry
chemical system should be rated at least one temperature rat-
ing lower than the temperature rating of the building sprin-
klers over the quench tanks.

A.9.3.2 At elevated temperatures, galvanizing can flake off
pipe surfaces, and the flakes can collect at and obstruct the
discharge of the fire suppression system.

A.10.2.1 Afterburner or fume incinerator systems might or
might not employ catalysts or various heat exchange devices to
reduce fuel usage.

Structural supports, thermal expansion joints, protective
insulation for incinerator housings, stacks, related ductwork,
and heat recovery systems utilizing incinerator exhaust gases
should be designed for operating temperatures of 450°F to
2000°F (232°C to 1093°C).

A.10.2.3 A regenerative thermal oxidizer design can maxi-
mize efficiency by maintaining a minimum volatile concentra-
tion in the airstream. To achieve this efficiency even when the
VOC source concentration varies, some designs inject a flam-
mable vapor into the airstream immediately upstream of the
oxidizer. The rate of injection may be controlled by tempera-
ture feedback or similar method. Care is needed to ensure
that the following conditions are met:

(1) The concentration of volatiles cannot exceed 25 percent
LFL (50 percent LFL with flammable vapor concentration
controller).
(2) The gas injection piping is isolated during purge (proved
closed).
(3) The gas injection is interlocked with the burner manage-
ment system (flame failure).

When operating temperatures are below 1400°F (760°C), a
1400°F (760°C) bypass interlock cannot be implemented in
accordance with Section 8.17.

A.10.6.1 Requirements for thermal ozidizers are located in
Chapter 10.

A.10.6.2 Fume incinerators should operate at the tempera-
ture necessary for the oxidation process and in accordance
with local, state, and federal regulations. Fume incinerators or
afterburners should control atmospheric hydrocarbon emis-
sions by direct thermal oxidation, generally in the range of
1200°F to 2000°F (650°C to 1093°C). Figure A.10.6.2 shows a
solvent fume incinerator with heat recovery.

A.10.6.2.1 An individual fume source or multiple sources
that feed into one fume incinerator might cause additional
hazards if fed into an operating incinerator during the purge
cycle of the source. (See 8.5.1.3.)

A.10.6.2.2 Operating controls should be configured to mini-
mize the likelihood of an excess temperature condition being
caused by one or more of the following:

(1) Reduction or termination of fuel to the fume incinerator
burner
(2) Interruption of the fume-generating process
(3) Dilution of hydrocarbon concentration with fresh air
(4) Partial emission stream bypass of the heat exchanger

A.10.6.3.3 When exhaust is recycled, it can reduce the oxygen
content supplied to the incinerator (reducing destruction effi-
ciency). This in turn will result in increased levels of flammable
vapors being exhausted into the oven for heat recovery purposes.
The system design should have inherent physical characteristics
to ensure that the ratio of heat recovery gases is limited to prevent
unsafe conditions or use a combination of telemetry controls and
interlocks to prevent this from occurring.

A.10.6.4 Catalytic fume incinerators should operate at the
temperature necessary for the catalytic oxidation process in
accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.

Catalytic fume incinerators control atmospheric hydrocar-
bon emissions by thermal oxidation, using a catalyst element.
Oxidation occurs at or near the auto-ignition temperature of
the contaminants, which ranges from 450°F to 950°F (232°C
to 510°C).

Catalyst elements utilize various types and forms of sub-
strates such as the following:

(1) Metal shavings
(2) Small, irregular metal castings
(3) Formed or stamped light-gauge sheet metal
(4) Ceramic-or porcelain-formed structures, pellets, or granules




2015 Edition NFPA

86-90 OVENS AND FURNACES

Most substrates are restricted to fixed bed applications, al-
though pellets and granules have application in fluidized beds
as well. Various catalyst materials are available and include rare
earth elements, precious metals such as platinum and palla-
dium, and a few metallic salts. For commercial use, the catalyst
material is bonded to or mixed in with (in the case of ceramic
or porcelain structures, pellets, or granules) the substrates
specified in the preceding list.

For atmospheric pollution control, catalyst materials fre-
quently are installed in oven exhaust streams, and the in-
creased energy level resulting from hydrocarbon oxidation is
either discharged to the outside atmosphere or recycled to the
process oven, directly or by means of a heat exchange system.

The application of catalysts should recognize the inherent
limitations associated with these materials, such as the inability
to oxidize silicone, sulfur, and halogenated compounds (cer-
tain catalysts employing base metals e.g., manganese and
copper - are resistant to halogens and sulfur poisons), as well
as metallic vapors such as tin, lead, and zinc. These materials
can destroy catalyst activity, whereas various inorganic particu-
lates (dust) can mask the catalyst elements and retard activity,
thus making specific maintenance procedures necessary. Con-
sultation with qualified suppliers and equipment manufactur-
ers is recommended prior to installation.

Where applicable, catalyst afterburner exhaust gases can
be permitted to be utilized as a heat source for the process
oven generating the vapors or some other unrelated process.
Heat recovery can be indirect, by the use of heat exchange
devices, or direct, by the introduction of the exhaust gases into
the process oven.

Alternatively, catalytic heaters can be permitted to be in-
stalled in the oven exhaust stream to release heat from evapo-
rated oven by-products, with available energy being returned
by means of heat exchange and recirculation to the oven pro-
cessing zone. [See Figure A.10.6.4(a) and Figure A.10.6.4(b).]

The diagram includes labels such as Odor-free exhaust, Catalyst, Fan, Preheat burner, Paint finishing oven, Work entrance, Burner, Work exit, Recirculation fan, Fresh air intake, and Oven heater, along with temperature indications 600°F, 500°F, and 400°F. Arrows indicate the direction of airflow within the system.

FIGURE A.10.6.4(a) Example of Catalyst System Indepen-
dent of Oven Heater for Air Pollution Control.

A.10.6.4.2 The temperature differential (7) across the cata-
lyst should be monitored to ensure that catalytic oxidation is
occurring. Separate temperature-indicating instruments or
controllers can be used to determine Tarithmetically. Control
of fuel or electrical energy for preheating the fume stream
entering the catalyst can utilize temperature-measuring instru-
ments at the catalyst inlet or discharge or at a juncture be-
tween instruments in each location. Maximum permitted af-
terburner temperature should be monitored only at the
catalyst bed exit. The value of Tacross the catalyst bed indi-
cates the energy release and should be limited to values non-
destructive to the catalyst material.

> [Figure] Diagram illustrating an indirect-type catalytic oven heater for full air pollution control. The diagram features components such as the Work entrance, Starting burner, Catalyst bed, Catalytic heater, Exhaust fan, Work exit, Recirculation fan, and Fresh air intake, depicting their arrangement within the system.

FIGURE A.10.6.4(b) Example of Indirect-Type Catalytic
Oven Heater for Full Air Pollution Control.

Regenerative catalyst oxidizers that employ flow reversal
through the system do not produce a measurable Tacross the
catalyst bed indicative of the energy released from the oxida-
tion of the combustibles. In regenerative catalytic oxidation
systems, the flow is reversed frequently through the system to
maximize utilization of process heat. One characteristic is that
the measured temperature at any one point in the system's
packed beds, whether in the heat matrix (ceramic packing) or
in the catalyst bed is never constant; rather, it is a sinusoidal
function of time. Measuring before and after the catalyst bed
does not show energy released from volatile organic com-
pound (VOC) oxidation. The fact that the catalyst bed is em-
ployed for VOC oxidation and heat recovery means that those
temperatures measured are dependent on flow rate, duration
between flow reversals, concentration of VOC, VOC species,
activity of catalyst, and burner input.

A.10.6.4.3 Concentrations at 25 percent LFL can produce a
temperature rise near 600°F (316°C) that, where added to the
required inlet temperature, results in temperatures generally
considered to be within a range where thermal degradation
occurs.

In the event of a high-temperature shutdown of the system,
the catalyst bed will need to be cooled to prevent further dam-
age to the catalyst through thermal or high-temperature
breakdown. Most catalysts employ a high surface area sub-
strate, such as alumina, that allows for the maximum amount
of catalyst material exposed to the fumes per unit of catalyst
(pellet, granule, or structured packing). The surface area of
the catalyst can be diminished through failure of the pore
structure of the substrate at elevated temperatures [typically
greater than 1200°F (649°C)], which results in less exposed
catalyst material per unit of catalyst and a lower activity. This
rate of thermal poisoning is a function of temperature and
duration, and the net effect can be minimized by quickly cool-
ing the catalyst to safe operating temperatures, from 450°F to
950°F (232°C to 510°C).

A.10.6.4.4 Oxidation performance of catalyst material is a
function of temperature, velocity, and pressure drop (P)
through the bed, with bed size and configuration directly re-
lated to these factors. Pressure drop across the bed fluctuates
with temperatures and particulate contamination. Contami-
nation can lead to reduced safety ventilation in the upstream
process.

A.10.6.4.5 Although the definition of a catalyst is a substance
that participates in a chemical reaction without being
changed by it, the reality is that catalysts are affected by chemi-
a

cal reactions and over time will lose their ability to promote
the desired chemical reaction. To ensure that a catalytic fume
incinerator is performing as intended, it is necessary to peri-
odically check the activity of the catalyst. The usual method is
to send a sample of the catalyst to the supplier for testing. The
need for obtaining samples should be addressed in the design
of the catalyst bed.

The consequence of declining catalyst activity is the incom-
plete destruction of the organic vapor. Among the products of
a partial combustion reaction are hydrogen, carbon monox-
ide, and aldehydes, all of which are flammable. The impact of
significant quantities of these flammable gases on the opera-
tion of a direct heat recovery system should be assessed by the
equipment supplier. Other potential concerns include the
odor and skin irritation that can be caused by the aldehydes.

plate Data.

A.11.4.4 See Section 7.6 regarding oven entry procedure and
asphyxiation warnings.

A.11.6.1.4 Chemical properties can be obtained from the
manufacturer's literature, published literature, or the tables
in A.11.6.8.4.

A.11.6.1.7 The use of propeller-type fans or blowers with
forward-curved blades for applications that involve vapors that
are not clean should be reviewed because of their susceptibility to
accumulation of deposits and possible loss of safety ventilation.

A.11.6.1.10 In the past, NFPA 86 prohibited ovens using a
single fan for both recirculation and exhaust. These dual-
purpose fan installations have a long history of fire and explo-
sion incidents. The primary cause of these incidents was short-
circuiting of safety ventilation resulting in pockets or zones in
which flammable vapors can concentrate.

The current text for 11.6.1.10 now permits alternative
means to dedicated exhaust fans for proving safety ventilation.
Accordingly, the user, oven designer, and the AHJ are cau-
tioned to carefully examine air flow of both incoming and
exhaust with respect to operating pressures, circulating meth-
odology, and proof of the air flow design.

Figure A.11.6.1.10 illustrates an example that is unaccept-
able because short-circuiting is possible as well as an example
that is potentially acceptable. The key in most cases is locating
the fresh air intake (s) in relation to the exhaust appropriately
to ensure that fresh air passes throughout the volume.

These drawings best pertain to batch ovens, as the open-
ings in a continuous oven alter pressure differentials creating
additional flow paths which must be taken into consideration.

A.11.6.1.16 The vapors of most volatile solvents and thinners
commonly used in finishing materials are heavier than air;
consequently, bottom ventilation is of prime importance (see
the tables in A.11.6.8.4). Liquefied petroleum gases are heavier
than air, and other fuel gases are lighter than air. See
NFPA 325, Fire-Hazard Properties of Flammable Liquids, Gases and
Volatile Solids. (Note: Although NFPA 325 has been officially
withdrawn from the National Fire Codes, the information is still
available in NFPA's Fire Protection Guide to Hazardous Materials.)

In areas outside the oven where volatiles are given off by
material prior to entering the oven, adequate provisions
should be made to exhaust vapors to the atmosphere in accor-
dance with applicable local, state, and federal regulations.

shown in Figure A.11.6.5(a) and Figure A.11.6.5(b).

A.11.6.5.1(A) *Example in U.S. Customary Units.* To draw
9200 ft³/min of fresh air referred to 70°F (530°R) into an
oven operating at 300°F (760°R), it is necessary to exhaust
13,200 actual ft³/min of heated air.

*Example in SI Units.* To draw 260 m³/min of fresh air referred
to 21°C (294 K) into an oven operating at 149°C (422 K), it is
necessary to exhaust 374 actual m³/min of heated air.

All volumes and volumetric flow values should indicate tem-
perature and pressure conditions [e.g., 100 ft³/min at 300°F
(2.83 m³/min at 148.9°C) and ambient pressure]. [0°F (-18°C)
is equivalent to 460°R (256 K).] [See Table 11.6.5.1(B)]

A.11.6.5.2(A) The altitude correction factor is needed be-
cause the volume of a gas varies in direct proportion to the
barometric pressure.

A.11.6.7 When the actual percent of volatile content released
during the oven cure cycle is not known, 9 percent has been
found to be a conservative estimate in most instances. The fur-
ther requirement to treat the released volatile mixture as if it
were xylene provides an additional safety factor, because xylene
has one of the highest ventilation rate requirements of com-
monly used solvents in paint coating and curing processes.
The solvent rate for powder curing ovens is calculated as
follows:

(1) Using the following equation, find the weight (W) of the
powder entering the oven per hour or per batch:

$W = \frac{S \times T}{C}$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  [A.11.6.7a]

where:
$W$ = maximum rate of powder delivered into oven
[lb (kg)/hr or lb (kg)/batch]
$S$ = surface area of parts to be coated
[ft²/hr (m²/hr)]
$T$ = maximum powder coating thickness [mil (mm)]
$C$ = manufacturer's recommended coverage in area
per weight powder for specified thickness
[Typically, 1 lb of powder covers 135 ft² to a
thickness of 0.001 in. (1 mil), and 1 kg of
powder covers 0.70 m² to a thickness of 1 mm.]

(2) Using the following equation, find the amount (G) of sol-
vent entering the oven per hour or per batch:

$G = \frac{R \times W}{lb (kg)/gal (L) \text{ of solvent}}$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        [A.11.6.7b]

where:
$G$ = amount of solvent entering the oven per hour or
per batch [gal (L)]
$R$ = percentage of powder constituents released
during oven cure cycle. An accepted value for a
typical powder and operating condition is
9 percent by weight, based on experimental
determination. Thus, 0.09 lb or 0.09 kg of
flammable constituents is released per pound or
per kilogram of powder cured. (An alternative
method for determining the percentage of
volatile content can be found in the Powder
Coating Institute publication "Recommended
Practice for Determination of Volatile Content of
Powder Coating Materials.")
$W$ = maximum rate of powder delivered into oven, as
determined in (1) [lb (kg)/hr or lb (kg)/batch]

Use the value calculated for $G$ in subsequent calculations
for continuous and batch process ovens per 11.6.8 and 11.6.9,
respectively.

A.11.6.8 *Explanatory Materials and Methods for Calculating Venti-* 
*lation in Various Types of Ovens*. The air delivered into an oven
by the supply system to do the necessary work can be all fresh
air (from a source outside the oven), or it can be partly fresh
air and partly recirculated air from within the oven. Only the
fresh air supplied provides safety ventilation, and the amount
of fresh air supplied must be equivalent to the amount of oven
exhaust air, to keep the system pressure in balance. The
amount of air discharged from the oven by the exhaust system
is a fair indication of the safety ventilation, provided the sup-
ply and exhaust systems are designed properly. The minimum
amount of fresh air delivered into the oven for safety ventila-
tion is established by the amount of solvent vaporized from the
work in process. The method for determining the minimum
volume of fresh air necessary for safety ventilation is provided
in A.11.6.8.4.

*Measurement of Quantity of Air Exhausted from an Oven*. A simple
method determining the quantity of air exhausted from an oven
is to measure the velocity of air through the discharge duct by
means of a velometer, an anemometer, a pitot tube, or other
suitable means. This measurement then is used to calculate the
volume (cubic feet or cubic meters) of air per minute by multi-
plying the velocity in lineal feet per minute (lineal meters per
minute) by the cross-sectional area of the exhaust duct in square
feet (square meters). The temperature of the exhaust air also
should be measured, and the calculated volume then corrected
to 70°F (21°C). The resultant quantity of air is an indication of
the volume exhausted from the oven, provided the exhaust air
does not mix with air external to the oven. In many ovens, par-
ticularly those of the continuous type, the exhaust ducts have
been incorrectly placed in locations that allow outside air to en-
ter the exhaust system together with the ventilation air exhausted
from the oven.

Example: For a continuous oven, determine the parts of
exhaust air at 300°F (149°C) and fresh air at 70°F (21°C) that,
when mixed, produce a resultant temperature of 242.5°F
(117°C), given the following conditions:

(1) The temperature reading of mixed air at discharge of the
exhaust fan is 242.5°F (117°C).

(2) The temperature reading of air in the oven at exhaust site
is 300°F (149°C).

(3) The temperature reading of outside air at the entrain-
ment site is 70°F (21°C).

U.S. Customary Units
$x$ = parts at 300°F
$y$ = parts at 70°F

242.  5 ($x + y$) = 300$x$ + 70$y$
243.  5$x$ + 242.5$y$ = 300$x$ + 70$y$
244. 5$y$ = 57.5$x$

3$y = x$

SI Units
$x$ = parts at 149°C
$y$ = parts at 21°C

117($x + y$) = 149$x$ + 21$y$
118.  7$x$ + 117$y$ = 149$x$ + 21$y$
119. $y$ = 32$x$

3$y = x$

Therefore, 3 parts at 300°F (149°C) + 1 part at 70°F (21°C) =
4 parts total at 242.5°F (117°C)

In this example, 75 percent of the air discharged by the
exhaust fan is from inside the oven. Correcting this volume for
70°F (21°C) establishes the amount of 70°F (21°C) fresh air
admitted into the oven.

In cases where all the fresh air admitted to the oven is through
one or more openings where the volume(s) can be measured
directly, it is not necessary to perform these calculations.

A.11.6.8.1 Because a considerable portion of the ventilating
air can pass through the oven without traversing the zone in
which the majority of vapors are given off, or because uniform
ventilation distribution might not exist, the 25 percent con-
centration level introduces a 4:1 factor of safety.

A.11.6.8.3 Most LFL values are reported at 77°F (25°C), al-
though several are given at 212°F (100°C). The LFL value de-
creases at higher temperatures, so it is necessary that the LFL
value for a particular solvent be corrected for the operating
temperature of the oven.

The formulas used in 11.6.8.3 were originally published in
Bureau of Mines Bulletin 627, "Flammability Characteristics of
Combustible Gases and Vapors." The temperature correction
factor also can be expressed approximately as a 5 percent re-
duction in the LFL value for each 100°F (37.8°C) rise in tem-
perature above 77°F (25°C).

A.11.6.8.4 Chemical properties can be obtained from manufac-
turers or from published data. The data in Table A.11.6.8.4(a)
and Table A.11.6.8.4(b) have been obtained from NFPA 325, *Fire-
Hazard Properties of Flammable Liquids, Gases and Volatile Solids*, and
material safety data sheets (MSDS) where available. Available fig-
ures from numerous sources vary over a wide range in many in-
stances, depending on the purity or grade of samples and on the
test conditions prescribed by different observers. (Note: Al-
though NFPA 325 has been officially withdrawn from the National
*Fire Codes*, the information is still available in NFPA's *Fire Protection
Guide to Hazardous Materials*.)

It is important to obtain precise data on the rate of evapo-
ration by actual tests on particular paint formulations in use.
Multiple-component preparations might contain several sol-
vents with widely differing values of LFL, specific gravity, and
vapor density. Until such determinations are made, the opera-
tion should be on the side of safety. Therefore, the individual
solvent whose data result in the largest required volume of air
per gallon should be used as the basis for safe ventilation.

*Sample Problem to Determine Required Ventilation*. For a con-
tinuous oven, determine the volume of oven dilution air that
would render vapor from a known volume of toluene barely
flammable, given the following:

(1) 1 gal of water weighs 8.328 lb at 70°F; 1 L of water weighs
0.998 kg at 21°C.
(2) Dry air at 70°F and 29.9 in. Hg weighs 0.075 lb/ft³; dry air
at 21°C and 0.76 m Hg weighs 1.200 kg/m³.
(3) 1 m³ = 1000 L = 1000 dm³
(4) The specific gravity ($SpGr$) of toluene = 0.87 (water = 1.0).
(5) The vapor density ($VD$) of toluene = 3.1 (air = 1.0).
(6) The LFL of toluene in air = 1.1 percent by volume [see
Table A. 11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b)] and in the LFL
calculations is expressed as 1.1 (not 0.011); this value for
the LFL is at standard ambient temperature of 70°F
(21°C).
(7) The measured oven exhaust temperature ($t$) = 300°F
(149°C).
(8) The corrected LFL ($LFL_7$) for oven exhaust temperature
is as follows (see 11.6.8.3):

[A.11.6.8.4a]

$(LFL)(LFL_{CF}) = 1.1[1-0.000784(149°C-25°C)]$

$= 0.99$

U.S. Customary Units. The following calculation is used to
determine the cubic feet (ft³) of vapor per gallon (gal) of
solvent:

$\frac{8.328}{0.075} \frac{SpGr}{VD} = ft³/gal at 70°F$

[A.11.6.8.4b]

For this example:

$\frac{8.328}{0.075} (\frac{0.87}{3.1})$ = 31.16 ft³ vapor per gal of toluene at 70°F

[A.11.6.8.4c]

$LFL_7$, being equivalent to 0.99 percent of the cubic feet of
air rendered explosive by 1 gal of toluene, is as follows:

[A.11.6.8.4d]

$31.16 (\frac{100-0.99}{0.99}) = 3116$ ft³ air at 70°F per gal toluene

Products of combustion must be added to this volume in
accordance with 11.6.6.1 and corrections then made for
higher oven exhaust temperature and, if applicable, for eleva-
tions of 1000 ft (305 m) or greater. An example of how these
additional factors are applied can be found in A.11.6.7.

SI Units. The following calculation is used to determine the
cubic meters (m³) of vapor per liter (L) of solvent:

[A.11.6.8.4e]

$\frac{0.998}{1.200} (\frac{SpGr}{VD}) = m³/L at 21°C$

For this example:

$\frac{0.998}{1.200} (\frac{0.87}{3.1}) = 0.233$ m³ vapor per L of toluene at 21°C

[A.11.6.8.4f]

$LFL_7$, being equivalent to 0.99 percent of the cubic meters
of air rendered explosive by 1 L of toluene, is as follows:

[A.11.6.8.4g]

$0.233 (\frac{100-0.99}{0.99}) = 23.30$ m³ air at 21°C per L toluene

Products of combustion must be added to this volume in
accordance with 11.6.6.1 and corrections then made for
higher oven exhaust temperature and, if applicable, for eleva-
tions of 1000 ft (305 m) or greater. An example of how these
additional factors are applied can be found in A.11.6.7.

Another Method of Computation. For this example, xylene is to
be used as the solvent, as follows:

(1) The specific gravity ($SpGr$) of xylene = 0.88 (water = 1.0).
(2) The molecular weight of xylene [$C_6H_4(CH_3)_2$] = 106.
(3) The LFL of xylene in air = 0.9 percent by volume [see
Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b)].
(4) The corrected LFL ($LFL_7$) for oven exhaust temperature
is as follows (see 11.6.8.3):

$(LFL) (LFL_{CF}) = 0.9 [1-0.000784 (149°C -25°C)] = 0.81$
(5) The molecular weight in pounds of any gas or vapor occu-
pies 387 ft³ at 70°F and 29.9 in. of mercury. The molecular
weight in grams of any gas or vapor occupies 24.1 L at
21°C and 101 kPa.

U.S. Customary Units. The weight of 1 gal xylene is as follows:

[A.11.6.8.4h]

$0.88 (\frac{8.328 \text{ lb H,O}}{gal}) = 7.33$ lb xylene/gal

The volume of 1 gal xylene, when vaporized, is as follows:

[A.11.6.8.4i]

$\frac{(7.33 \text{ lb}) (387 ft³)}{106 \text{ (molecular weight)}}$

$LFL_T$, being equivalent to 0.81 percent of the cubic feet of
air rendered explosive by 1 gal xylene, is as follows:

$26.76 (\frac{100-0.81}{0.81}) = 3277 \text{ ft}^3 \text{ air at } 70^\circ \text{F per gal xylene}$   [A.11.6.8.4j]

Products of combustion must be added to this volume in
accordance with 11.6.6.1 and corrections then made for
higher oven exhaust temperature and, if applicable, for eleva-
tions of 1000 ft (305 m) or greater. An example of how these
additional factors are applied can be found in A.11.6.7.

$SI \text{ Units. The weight of 1 L xylene, when vaporized, is as}$ 
follows:

$(\frac{0.998 \text{ kg } H_2O}{L}) (\frac{1000 \text{ g}}{\text{kg}}) (0.88 \text{ SpGr}) = 878 \text{ g xylene/L}$   [A.11.6.8.4k]

The volume of 1 L xylene, when vaporized, is as follows:

$\frac{(878 \text{ g}) (24.1 \text{ L})}{106 \text{ (molecular weight)}} = 200 \text{ L xylene vapor at standard conditions}$   [A.11.6.8.4l]

$LFL_T$, being equivalent to 0.81 percent of the cubic meters
of air rendered explosive by 1 L xylene, is as follows:

$200 \text{ L} (\frac{100-0.81}{0.81}) (\frac{1 \text{ m}^3}{1000 \text{ L}}) = \frac{24.49 \text{ m}^3 \text{ air at}}{21^\circ \text{C per L xylene}}$   [A.11.6.8.4m]

Products of combustion must be added to this volume in
accordance with 11.6.6.1 and corrections then made for
higher exhaust temperature and, if applicable, for elevations
of 1000 ft (305 m) or greater. An example of how these addi-
tional factors are applied can be found in A.11.6.7.

A.11.6.8.4(C) The basis for the general rule is that 1 gal of
typical solvent produces a quantity of flammable vapor that,
when diffused in air, forms approximately 2640 scf of a lean
mixture that is barely explosive (1 L of a typical solvent forms
approximately 19.75 standard m³ of a lean mixture that is
barely explosive). Refer to Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table
A.11.6.8.4(b). The value of 12,000 ft³ (340 m³) includes a fac-
tor to account for LFL correction at 350°F (177°C).

A.11.6.8.5 Caution is needed when determining the maxi-
mum allowable gallons per minute of solvent entering the
oven. It is not uncommon for designers to propose that only a
fraction of the solvent actually enters an oven zone since much
of the solvent has already been driven off either in a flash-off
booth or in upstream oven zones. Because proof of safety ven-
tilation is based on the measuring of exhaust, contaminated
infiltration air from these upstream processes can represent a
significant fraction of the air used for safety ventilation, par-
ticularly during "upset conditions" in which the oven exhaust
and recirculation systems might be imbalanced.

Moreover, many airflow proving devices are not able to
prove minimum airflow rates with any accuracy; rather, they
prove air movement. Accordingly, assumptions that an ex-
haust airflow switch proves an exhaust airflow rate sufficient to
dilute solvent vapor to 25% LFL7 must take into account vari-
ables introduced by changes in damper settings and the po-
tential for a fraction of infiltration air to be contaminated by
flammable vapors.

A general common solution cannot be provided due to the
large number of variations in design and operation param-
eters for oven curing processes.

A.11.6.9 Following are sample calculations for batch ovens.

Example 1. Sample calculations for electrically heated batch oven processes coated metal using approximation method. Dipped product through batch oven operating at 300°F (149°C) at sea level. Volatiles in paint = 3 gal (11.4 L) of volatiles (mostly methyl ethyl ketone) per batch into oven.

U.S. Customary Units. Required ventilation, theoretically not to reach the LFL [see 11.6.9.3 and 11.6.5], is as follows:

[A.11.6.9a]

$\left(440\ \text{scfm}\right)\left(\frac{3 \ \text{gal}}{\text{batch}}\right)(1.4 \ \text{factor}) = 1848\ \text{scfm air}$

Correction for oven temperature is as follows:

[A.11.6.9b]

$1848\left(\frac{300^\circ\text{F} + 460^\circ\text{F}}{70^\circ\text{F} + 460^\circ\text{F}}\right) = 2650\ \text{ft}^3/\text{min of air at } 300^\circ\text{F}$

SI Units. Required ventilation, theoretically not to reach the LFL [see 11.6.9.3 and 11.6.5], is as follows:

[A.11.6.9c]

$\left(\frac{3.29\ \text{standard m}^3}{\text{min}}\right)\left(\frac{11.4\ \text{L}}{\text{batch}}\right)(1.4\ \text{factor}) = 52.5\ \text{standard m}^3/\text{min of air}$

Correction for oven temperature is as follows:

[A.11.6.9d]

$52.5\left(\frac{149^\circ\text{C} + 273^\circ\text{C}}{21^\circ\text{C} + 273^\circ\text{C}}\right) = 75.3\ \text{m}^3/\text{min of air at } 149^\circ\text{C}$

Example 2. Sample calculations for electrically heated batch oven processes ventilation calculation using test measurements. Batch oven operating at 255°F (124°C) at sea level curing transformer coils impregnated with coating containing 4.8 gal (18.2 L) of volatiles, mostly toluene. Tests under operating conditions indicate that over 5 hours were needed to evaporate all volatiles with the peak evaporation rate occurring in the first 5 minutes after loading, at a rate of 0.06 gal/min (0.227 L/min). The calculated ventilation rate, including a temperature correction factor for LFL for batch ovens [see 11.6.9.2 and 11.6.5], is as follows:

U.S. Customary Units. Barely flammable mixture at peak evaporation rate [see Table A. 11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b)] is as follows:

[A.11.6.9e]

$\left(\frac{2800\ \text{scf air}}{\text{gal toluene}}\right)\left(\frac{0.06\ \text{gal}}{\text{min}}\right) = 168\ \text{scfm mixture at LEL}$

Safety ventilation calculation is as follows:

$168\ \text{scfm} \times 4\ (\text{factor of safety}) \times 1.4\ (\text{LFL temperature adjustment}) = 941\ \text{scfm of air}$

Correction for oven temperature is as follows:

[A.11.6.9f]

$\left(941\ \text{scfm}\right)\left(\frac{255^\circ\text{F} + 460^\circ\text{F}}{70^\circ\text{F} + 460^\circ\text{F}}\right) = 1269\ \text{ft}^3/\text{min of air at } 255^\circ\text{F}$

SI Units. Barely flammable mixture at peak evaporation rate [see Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A. 11.6.8.4(b) ] is as follows:

[A.11.6.9g]

$\left(\frac{21.04\ \text{standard m}^3\ \text{air}}{\text{L toluene}}\right)\left(\frac{0.227\ \text{L}}{\text{min}}\right) = 4.78\ \text{standard m}^3\ \text{mixture/min at LEL}$

Safety ventilation calculation is as follows:

[A.11.6.9h]

$\frac{4.78\ \text{m}^3}{\text{min}}\times 4(\text{factor of safety}) \times 1.4$

(LFL temperature adjustment) = 26.77 standard m³/min

Correction for oven temperature is as follows:

[A.11.6.9i]

$\left(\frac{26.77\ \text{standard m}^3}{\text{min}}\right)\left(\frac{124^\circ\text{C} + 273^\circ\text{C}}{21^\circ\text{C} + 273^\circ\text{C}}\right) = 36.15\ \text{m}^3/\text{min of air at } 124^\circ\text{C}$

Example 3. Sample calculations for electrically heated batch oven processes; known solvent volume. A batch oven cures a load of fiber rings impregnated with thinned asphalt at 480°F (249°C), the volatiles being mostly Mineral Spirits No. 10. From weight tests of samples removed throughout the cure, it was established that the maximum amount of volatiles evaporated in any 1-hour period is 2.3 gal (8.7 L), and the total weight loss throughout the cure is equivalent to 6.6 gal (25.0 L). The installation is at sea level. The estimated ventilation required in 11.6.9.2.

U.S. Customary Units. Barely flammable mixture of Mineral Spirits No. 10 [see Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b)] is as follows:

[A.11.6.9j]

$\left(\frac{2836\ \text{ft}^3\ \text{mixture}}{\text{gal M.S. No.10}}\right)\left(\frac{2.3\ \text{gal}}{\text{hr}}\right) = 6523\ \text{scf/hr mixture at LFL}$

Calculated ventilation volume is as follows:

[A.11.6.9k]

$6523\ \text{scfm} \times \frac{10}{60} \times 1.4\ (\text{LFL temp. adjustment}) = 1522\ \text{scfm of air}$

Correction for oven temperature is as follows:

[A.11.6.9l]

$\left(1522\ \text{scfm}\right)\left(\frac{480^\circ\text{F} + 460^\circ\text{F}}{70^\circ\text{F} + 460^\circ\text{F}}\right) = 2699\ \text{ft}^3/\text{min of air at } 480^\circ\text{F}$

SI Units. Barely flammable mixture of Mineral Spirits No. 10 [see Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b)] is as follows:

[A.11.6.9m]

$\left(\frac{21.21\ \text{m}^3\ \text{mixture}}{\text{L M.S. No. 10}}\right)\left(\frac{8.7\ \text{L}}{\text{hr}}\right) = 184.5\ \text{standard m}^3/\text{hr mixture at LFL}$

Calculated ventilation volume is as follows:

$\frac{184.5 \frac{m^3}{hr} \times \frac{10}{60} \times 1.4}{}$ (LFL temp. adjustment) [A.11.6.9n]

= 43.1 standard m³/min of air

Correction for oven temperature is as follows: [A.11.6.9o]

$(\frac{43.1 \text{ standard } m^3}{\text{hr}})(\frac{249°C + 273°C}{21°C + 273°C})$

= 76.21 m³/min of air at 249°C

A.11.6.9.1 There are numerous factors to consider, including
the initial solvent load when the batch oven is charged at the
initial and operating temperatures over time, the ventilation
rate, the effect of temperature on the solvent LFL, and the
altitude. The calculation and estimation methods provided in
this standard have been found by empirical test data and suc-
cessful operation over time to prevent concentrations over
LFL. No calculation method can account for unpredicted up-
set conditions or improper operation.

A.11.6.9.3 Industrial experience indicates that the nature of
the work being cured is the main factor in determining the
safety ventilation rate. Different types of work produce differ-
ent rates of evaporation, and field tests show that sheet metal
or parts coated by dipping generally produce the highest
evaporation rates. Tests and years of experience have shown
that 440 scfm of air per gal (3.29 standard m³/min of air per
L) of flammable volatiles is reasonably safe for dipped metal.

A.11.6.9.3(Β) (2) *Explanatory Materials and Methods for Calculat-*
*ing Ventilation in Various Types of Ovens*. The air delivered into
an oven by the supply system to do the necessary work can be
all fresh air (from a source outside the oven), or it can be
partly fresh air and partly recirculated air from within the
oven. Only the fresh air supplied provides safety ventilation,
and the amount of fresh air supplied must be equivalent to the
amount of oven exhaust air, to keep the system pressure in
balance. The amount of air discharged from the oven by the
exhaust system is a fair indication of the safety ventilation,
provided the supply system and the exhaust system are de-
signed properly. The minimum amount of fresh air delivered
into the oven for safety ventilation is established by the
amount of solvent vaporized from the work in process. The
method for determining the minimum volume of fresh air
necessary for safety ventilation is provided in A.11.6.7.

*Measurement of Quantity of Air Exhausted from an Oven*. A
simple method of determining the quantity of air exhausted
from an oven is to measure the velocity of air through the
discharge duct by means of a velometer, an anemometer, a
pitot tube, or other suitable means. This measurement then is
used to calculate the volume (cubic feet or cubic meters) of air
per minute by multiplying the velocity in lineal feet per
minute (lineal meters per minute) by the cross-sectional area
of the exhaust duct in square feet (square meters). The tem-
perature of the exhaust air also should be measured and the
calculated volume then corrected to 70°F (21°C). The result-
ant quantity of air is an indication of the volume exhausted
from the oven, provided the exhaust air does not mix with air
external to the oven. In many ovens, particularly those of the
continuous type, the exhaust ducts have been incorrectly
placed in locations that allow outside air to enter the exhaust
system together with the ventilation air exhausted from the
oven.

*Example:* For a continuous oven, determine the parts of ex-
haust air at 300°F (149°C) and fresh air at 70°F (21°C) that,
when mixed, produce a resultant temperature of 242.5°F
(117°C), given the following conditions:

(1) The temperature reading of mixed air at discharge of the
exhaust fan is 242.5°F (117°C).
(2) The temperature reading of air in oven at exhaust site is
300°F (149°C).
(3) The temperature reading of outside air at the entrain-
ment site is 70°F (21°C).

*U.S. Customary Units*
x = parts at 300°F
y = parts at 70°F
242.5 (x + y) = 300x + 70y
242.5x + 242.5y = 300x + 70y
172.5y = 57.5x
3y = x

*SI Units*
x = parts at 149°C
y = parts at 21°C
117 (x + y) = 149x + 21 y
117x + 117y = 149x + 21y
96y = 32x
3y = x

Therefore, 3 parts at 300°F (149°C) + 1 part at 70°F (21°C) =
4 parts total at 242.5°F (117°C)

In this example, 75 percent of the air discharged by the
exhaust fan is from inside the oven. Correcting this volume for
70°F (21°C) establishes the amount of 70°F (21°C) fresh air
admitted into the oven.

In cases where all the fresh air admitted to the oven is through
one or more openings where the volume(s) can be measured
directly, it is not necessary to perform these calculations.

A.11.6.9.4 Extensive tests have been conducted by Underwrit-
ers Laboratories Inc. (Bulletin of Research No. 43, "The
Lower Limit of Flammability and the Autogenous Ignition
Temperature of Certain Common Solvent Vapors Encoun-
tered in Ovens") to obtain data regarding the effect of el-
evated temperatures on the LFL of many of the solvents com-
monly used in connection with ovens. These tests show that
the LFL of all solvents tested decreases as the temperature
increases, leading to the conclusion that more air [referred to
70°F (21°C)] is required for safety per gallon (liter) of solvent
as the oven temperature increases. The actual figures vary con-
siderably with different solvents.

A.11.6.10.2 In many operations, the continuous vapor con-
centration high limit controller could be required to respond
to an upset condition in less than 5 seconds to detect transient
upsets. This response requires the controller to be located
close to the sampling point to minimize transport time and
generally precludes the use of one controller sequentially sam-
pling multiple points.

show that a given process line will not exceed 25 percent LFL
requires detailed knowledge, modeling, and testing of the

A.11.7.1.2 Low-oxygen ovens, also called inert ovens, operate
safely at a much higher concentration of solvent vapor by lim-
iting the oxygen concentration. Oxygen concentration within
the appropriate equipment is kept low by the addition of an
inert gas. (See Figure A.11.7.1.2.)

oxygen concentration, which is different for each solvent. See

vents and the figure in A.11.7.12(1) (1) for the flammable re-
gion for two common solvents.

denser system, pumps, filters, tanks, level controls, and distil-
lation equipment.

A.11.6.10.4 When a continuous vapor concentration control-
ler is used to modulate the flow of fresh air into or exhaust
from an oven, there is a possibility that a malfunction of the
controller will lead to a hazardous situation. For that reason,
another protection system is required. The simplest form of
backup is a fixed damper stop that is set so that the oven sol-
vent concentration cannot exceed 50 percent LFL for the
highest design solvent input rate. The disadvantage of the
fixed damper stop is that it limits the ability of the controls to
reduce the dilution air when the solvent input is low. In-
creased flexibility is the main advantage for using a separate
continuous vapor concentration high limit controller as the
system backup.

A.11.6.10.9 The sequence might include opening the ex-
haust and fresh air dampers, shutting down heaters, stopping
the conveyor or web, stopping the coating process, and stop-
ping or removing the coating material.

A.11.7.4(3) Ventilation should be provided at the oven open-
ings to capture any escaping solvent vapors.

A.11.7.5 All storage tanks and compressed gas cylinders
should comply with local, state, and federal codes and appli-
cable NFPA standards relating to the types of fluids stored,
their pressures, and their temperatures.

A.11.7.6.6 A flow-limiting device such as a critical flow-
metering orifice, sized to limit the flow at the maximum inlet
pressure, can fulfill this requirement.

A.11.7.7.1 The flow rate can be varied during the course of
the process cycle.

A.11.7.8.3 Commercial-grade carbon steel pipe exhibits a
marked reduction in impact strength when cooled to subzero
temperatures. Consequently, it is vulnerable to impact fracture if
located downstream of a vaporizer running beyond its rated va-
porization capacity or at very low ambient temperature.

A.11.7.9.1 The core of the safety system is the reliable moni-
toring of oxygen on a continuous basis, with shutdown if the
oxygen level becomes too high.

A.11.7.9.3 Personnel should be provided with independent
analyses of solvent and oxygen concentration before entry. (See
Chapter 7 and Annex B.)

A.11.7.12(1) See Figure A.11.7.12(1).

A.12.5.1 The installation of any equipment can increase the
pressure drop of the system and therefore reduce the flow rate.

A.13.5.1.3 See A.6.2.6.3.

A.13.5.2 The combustion reaction is self-supporting and gives
off heat (i.e., it is exothermic). The usual combustion range is
from 60 percent to 100 percent of the stoichiometric ratio (aera-
tion). In exothermic generators, the combustion products be-
come the atmosphere gas; therefore, the gaseous constituents
supplied to exothermic generators are called *fuel gas* and *air*.

A.13.5.2.1 Cuprous acetylide $(Cu_2C_2)$ is formed by exposure
of acetylene to copper in an alkaline aqueous environment.
When the water is removed and the cuprous acetylide is dried
out, a minor impact or frictional force will cause a violent,
explosive reaction.

Acetylene is produced in small quantities in the exother-
mic gas-generating process. Water is a by-product of the exo-
thermic atmosphere-generating process, and in many designs
water is used to directly cool the gas. The water can be alkaline
due to many chemical influences internal or external to the
gas-generating equipment.

A.13.5.3 Subsection 13.5.3 applies to those generators that
require the addition of heat to complete the reaction of the
gas and air generating the atmosphere and in which the atmo-
sphere being generated is separated at all times from the heat-
ing combustion products or other heating medium.

The separation of atmosphere is effected by use of retorts,
tubes, pipes, or other special vessels. To simplify this standard,
all gas used in the reaction with air to create the atmosphere is
called *reaction gas*, and all air used in this reaction is called
*reaction air*. Gas burned with air to supply heat is called *fuel gas*,
and all air used with the fuel gas is called *combustion air*. The
atmosphere produced in the generator from heating the mix-
ture of reaction gas and reaction air is called *special atmosphere
gas*. The reaction gas and the fuel gas might or might not be
the same type of gas.

Note: To purge from any operating point on the 8 percent oxygen
operating line, purge with inert gas to reach the solvent concentration
at C (LOC), then purge with air. This avoids passing through the
flammability region by a comfortable margin.

> [Figure]
> This figure shows two graphs demonstrating the purging requirements for acetone and heptane. Both graphs plot %O2 on the y-axis (ranging from 0 to 20) against % Acetone or % Heptane on the x-axis (ranging from 0 to 100). Each graph includes lines representing the Lower Flammable Limit (LFL), Upper Flammable Limit (UFL), and Limiting Oxygen Concentration (LOC), as well as air and inert purge lines. The flammable region is indicated on each graph. The first graph depicts purging requirements for acetone, where A (LFL) = 2.5%, B (UFL) = 12.8%, and C (LOC) = 11.5% oxygen and 3.8% (est.) acetone. The second graph illustrates purging requirements for heptane, where A (LFL) = 1.05%, B (UFL) = 6.7%, and C (LOC) = 11.5% oxygen and 1.8% (est.) heptane.

A.13.5.3.5 Certain system designs can require additional ap-
proved protective equipment to the reaction section, and the
following components should be considered:

(1) Flowmeters
(2) Meters or pressure gauges on the reaction gas and reac-
tion air supplies

A.13.5.4 Subsection 13.5.4 applies to those types of genera-
tors in which ammonia is dissociated into hydrogen and nitro-
gen by the action of heat and is separated at all times from the
heating combustion products or other heating medium.

A.13.5.4.2(A) Certain system designs can require additional
approved protective equipment, and the following compo-
nents should be considered:

(1) Flow indicators
(2) Meters
(3) Pressure gauges on reaction gas

A.13.5.5 Vaporizers used for safety purging to convert cryo-
genic liquids to the gas state should be ambient air heat trans-
fer units so that flow from such vaporizers is unaffected by the
loss of power.

The use of powered vaporizers is permitted where one of
the following conditions is satisfied:

(1) The vaporizer has reserve heating capacity to continue va-
porizing at least five furnace volumes at the required purge
flow rate immediately following power interruption.
(2) Reserve ambient vaporizers are provided that are piped to
the source of supply so that they are unaffected by a
freeze-up or flow stoppage of gas from the powered vapor-
izer. The reserve vaporizers should be capable of evapo-
rating at least five furnace volumes at the required purge
flow rate.
(3) Purge gas is available from an alternative source that is
capable of supplying five volume changes after interrup-
tion of the flow of the atmosphere gas to the furnace.

Vaporizers should be rated by the industrial gas supplier or
the owner to vaporize at 150 percent of the highest purge gas
demand for all connected equipment. Winter temperature ex-
tremes for the locale should be taken into consideration by
the agency responsible for rating the vaporizers.

The industrial gas supplier should be informed of addi-
tions to the plant that materially increase the inert gas con-
sumption rate so that vaporizer and storage capacity can be
resized for the revised requirements.

A temperature indicator should be installed in the vapor-
izer outlet piping for use in evaluating its evaporation perfor-
mance at any time.

A device should be installed that prevents the flow rate of
gas from exceeding the vaporizer capacity and thereby threat-
ening the integrity of downstream equipment or control de-
vices due to exposure to cryogenic fluids. A break in the down-
stream pipeline or failure (opening) of the supply pressure
regulator could cause excessive flow. Exceeding the capacity
of an atmospheric vaporizer leads to a gradual decrease in gas
temperature that can be remedied by decreasing the demand
on the vaporizer.

In atmospheric vaporizers, in lieu of the flow-limiting de-
vice, a visual and audible alarm should indicate to operators in
the vicinity of the furnace that the temperature of the vapor-
izer outlet gas has fallen below a minimum level, indicating a
potential to exceed vaporizer capacity.

ing Compressed Gas Association (CGA) guidelines:

(6) CGA P-1, *Safe Handling of Compressed Gases in Containers*

A.13.5.6 Gas atmosphere mixing systems are used to create spe-
cial processing atmospheres made up of two or more gases. The
majority are built to create binary nitrogen-hydrogen blends, but
they also are able to create mixtures of other gases. The blended
gas of gas atmosphere mixing systems usually has a constant flam-
mable or indeterminate composition and is supplied on a pres-
sure or demand basis to the special processing atmosphere flow
controls situated at one or more furnaces.

Gas atmosphere mixing systems typically incorporate a
surge tank mixing scheme that cycles between set pressure
limits. This feature distinguishes them from the flow control
systems covered in 13.5.7.

A.13.5.6(1) Consideration should be given to the inclusion of
filters or strainers to improve reliable functioning of pressure

86-108 OVENS AND FURNACES

regulators, flowmeters, flow monitors, control valves, and
other components.

A.13.5.7.1 The object of this requirement is to prevent infil-
tration of air that could be detrimental to the work being pro-
cessed or could result in the creation of flammable gas-air
mixtures within the furnace. The flow rates can be varied dur-
ing the course of a heat treatment cycle.

A.13.5.7.3 After closure of an outer vestibule door of a batch-
type furnace or a pusher furnace, a delay usually occurs before
burn-off resumes at the vent opening. The duration of the
delay depends on the special atmosphere flow rate, its com-
bustibles content, the vestibule volume, and other factors.

A.13.5.7.4(B) The indication of flow is intended to be pro-
vided by a device that will indicate flow any time a flow is oc-
curring, including during a power outage. A mechanical de-
vice that indicates the flow rate without using any source of
power except the physical flow of the inert purge gas meets
this requirement. The uncertainty of a reliable backup power
supply, such as backup batteries or an uninterruptible power
supply, during a primary power interruption precludes the use
of "electronic" monitoring of flow.

A.13.5.8.3 Inadequate dissociation results in lessened atmo-
sphere expansion, which causes a reduction in furnace pres-
sure and thereby creates an air infiltration hazard.

Insufficient temperature also can create a condition in which
unvolatized atmosphere fluid is carried into the quench tank,
changing the physical characteristics of the quench oil, such as
increasing the vapor pressure and lowering the flash point.

A.13.5.8.11 Filters or strainers should be provided to ensure
reliable functioning of pressure regulators, flowmeters, flow
monitors, control valves, and other components.

A.13.5.8.12(1) Paragraph 13.5.8.12(1) addresses excess flow in
the equipment piping for an individual furnace. This involves a
device at the special atmosphere control panel, such as an elec-
tronic sensor, along with logic to close an automatic shutoff valve
upon detection of excess flow. Paragraph 13.5.8.12(1) does not
preclude operational high flow set points at thresholds below the
shutoff excess flow set point. The operational high flow set points
can be provided to initiate alarms that prompt operator interven-
tion to restore appropriate flow levels before the shutoff excess
flow level is reached.

A.13.5.10 Refer to the definitions for special atmosphere in 3.3.67.

A.13.5.11.1(B) Failure to maintain positive pressure in a fur-
nace can allow air infiltration. Air infiltration can occur at ef-
fluents, open ends, or the perimeter of doors. In addition,
weld in a furnace shell can break, gasketed joints can fail, and
radiant tube heaters can be breached, all of which could intro-
duce additional sources of air infiltration. Furnaces should be
designed to minimize sources of air infiltration. In addition,
furnace shell joints and radiant tube heaters should be peri-
odically evaluated or tested and repaired as needed. Should
positive furnace pressure be lost in furnaces or chambers op-
erating below 1400°F (760°C), air infiltration can lead to a
flammable gas-air mixture that can result in an explosion.
Loss of positive furnace pressure can be caused by an inad-
equate flow of carrier gases or loss of furnace heat, and loss of
furnace heat will lead to the thermal contraction of the atmo-
sphere volume.

A.13.5.11.1(C) The character of the flame at furnace open
ends and special atmosphere effluents will be a function of the
specific furnace. It is essential for the furnace operator to be
trained to recognize the "established character" of these
flames. In addition, the operator should be aware of the typi-
cal timing for flame to appear at open ends and effluent vents.

A.13.5.11.1(D) The fluid in a bubbler can be water or oil.
Bubblers might be provided to protect a furnace from over-
pressure or to maintain a minimum positive atmosphere pres-
sure within the furnace. Bubblers also can control pressure
within a bell furnace using an oil seal. Overpressure of the
retort or work chamber could blow the oil out of the seal ring.
It is also possible to have water condensation accumulate in a
bubbler bottle that can add to the liquid level and allow an
increase in furnace pressure, which could increase furnace
pressure to excessive levels and lead to the loss of oil seals.

A.13.5.11.1(E) Where flammable atmosphere effluent is re-
leased unburned to the interior of a building, the accumula-
tion of flammable gases could create a fire or explosion haz-
ard. To avoid this hazard, effluent that will not reliably ignite
upon contact with air should be captured by a hood and dis-
charged to a safe outside location. See also A.6.2.6.3, which
addresses additional hazards.

A.13.5.11.1(F) The use of plant air with reducing regulators
is prohibited. Plant air lines can become slugged with water
passing into the heated furnace resulting in abnormally high
furnace pressures. Plant air lines can experience regulator fail-
ures resulting in high-pressure air admission into a furnace
that contains a flammable atmosphere.

A.13.5.11.2(B) Burn-off pilots using full premix (fuel-gas
mixed with all the air needed to support full combustion) and
glow plugs are examples of ignition sources meeting the in-
tent of A.13.5.11.2(B). Full premix burn-off pilots have suffi-
cient air (or, more precisely, sufficient oxygen in air) pre-
mixed with the fuel gas to maintain the burn-off pilot if the
purge gas or special atmosphere gas otherwise creates an
oxygen-deficient atmosphere that would not support the
burning of the burn-off pilot flame.

A.13.5.11.2(C) Where loss of ignition of vent effluent creates
either an environmental or a personal safety concern, the pi-
lot flame should be monitored and an alarm generated to
alert the operator to loss of flame.

A.13.5.11.2(E) The ability to open doors manually in emer-
gency situations is needed. Upon the simultaneous loss of fur-
nace atmosphere and door pilot supervision, there will be a
need to purge or manually open doors to burn-out vestibules
that use an alternative source of ignition.

A.13.5.11.2(G) If burn-off pilots were equipped with flame
supervision interlocked to turn fuel gas off to the burn-off
pilot upon loss of flame, the burn-off pilots would also be
turned off in the event of a power failure. The loss of burn-off
pilots at special atmosphere effluent points during a power
failure is undesirable and would create a serious safety con-
cern with reliably maintaining ignition of effluents. Where
flame supervision is provided, it is for an alarm to draw atten-
tion to the need to relight the burn-off pilot or it is interlocked
to prevent the opening of a furnace door.

A.13.5.11.2(H) Burn-off pilots should be located where they
will contact the effluent stream. For example, for a lighter-
than-air effluent flowing from a furnace open end, the efflu-
ent most likely will be encountered at the top of the opening.

ANNEX A                                                                                                                                          86-109

A.13.5.11.2(J) Burn-off pilots are not to be interrupted by any
action other than closing of their individual manual shutoff
valve or closing of the main equipment manual shutoff valve.

A.13.5.11.3 Regarding items (2) and (5), once a door begins
to open, it is intended that the door will be permitted to open
completely. The interlock is only intended to prevent a closed
door from opening.

A.13.5.11.3(6) The manual override is provided for abnormal
conditions to permit the manual removal of special atmo-
spheres from the furnace.

Α.13.5.11.6.1 (A) Purge effectiveness can be compromised by
actions such as operating furnace doors, operating quench
elevators, introducing work, and operating fans not included
in the purge process. Purge effectiveness can also be compro-
mised by not running fans required to effect the purge. Avoid-
ing such actions can be accomplished by written operating
procedures or interlocks.

A.13.5.11.6.4 Verification of flammable special atmosphere
safety shutoff valves being closed can be accomplished by op-
erator observation.

A.13.5.11.6.7 Flammable atmosphere-air interfaces occur at
doors, open ends, effluents, and other locations where the
flammable atmosphere contacts air. Active sources of ignition
include door burn-off pilots, flame curtains, manual torches,
door effluents above 1400°F (760°C), glow plugs, and hot
door parts above 1400°F (760°C). Atmosphere-air interfaces
can be avoided by a nitrogen seal.

Where a furnace has open ends or doors, a flame of estab-
lished character appearing at open ends or atmosphere efflu-
ents indicates that the atmosphere introduction has been
completed or is being maintained.

Furnaces without open ends or doors, such as bell furnaces
and strip processing furnaces with sealed entrance and exit,
might not have ignited effluent lines. As such, the operator
might not know if or when the flammable atmosphere intro-
duction is complete; however, because the furnace is sealed
and positive pressure is maintained, this is not a safety con-
cern. The operator is not using the effluent flame as an indi-
cator for determining when to cycle loads or operate doors.

The character of the flame at furnace open ends and spe-
cial atmosphere effluents is a function of the specific furnace.
It is essential that the furnace operator be trained to recognize
the "established character" of these flames.

A.13.5.11.6.8 The furnace volume includes chambers, zones,
covers, and retorts that contain the flammable special atmo-
sphere within the furnace. Ductwork associated with recircu-
lating fans such as jet coolers are considered part of the fur-
nace volume, as are features such as large door housings or
chambers and large pusher chain or mechanism housings that
are exposed to the flammable special atmosphere.

A.13.5.11.6.11(4) Oil level directly affects the volume of the
vestibule. Flammable special atmosphere introduction should
not begin without quench oil being at the appropriate level.
Atmosphere introduction should not be interrupted once
started.

A.13.5.11.6.12 The character of the flame at furnace open
ends and special atmosphere effluents will be a function of the
specific furnace. It is essential that the furnace operator be
trained to recognize the "established character" of these
flames. In addition, the operator should be aware of the typi-
cal timing for flame to appear at open ends and effluent vents.
Furnaces, such as heating-cover types, that have no open
ends, doors, or effluent lines will have no features to provide
indicators of visible flame. This is an acceptable arrangement
and is addressed by the specific furnace design and operating
instructions.

Α.13.5.11.7.1 (A) Burn-in effectiveness can be compromised
by actions that are not included in the burn-in operating in-
structions. Furnace doors, quench elevators, and fans should
not be operated except in accordance with written burn-in
operating instructions. Work should not be introduced into a
furnace during the burn-in process. Burn-in effectiveness can
also be compromised by running or not running fans in accor-
dance with written burn-in instructions.

Α.13.5.11.7.2 The burn-in process is anticipated to reduce
the oxygen level within the furnace to a point at or below
1 percent as the oxygen in air is consumed by the burn-in
process.

A.13.5.11.7.3 Any flammable atmosphere gas introduced
into a chamber at or above 1400°F (760°C) will be reliably
ignited by auto-ignition. An alternative method of atmosphere
gas ignition, beyond just the burning flame front, might be
needed where the burning atmosphere gas enters chambers
below 1400°F (760°C).

A.13.5.11.7.4 Long cooling tunnels can extinguish the burn-
ing atmosphere flame front by cooling the atmosphere gas as
it moves along the length of the tunnel.

A.13.5.11.7.5 In some furnace designs, such as the Type II
furnace (integral quench batch furnace), manual torches
might be needed as a means to reliably ignite flammable atmo-
sphere gas as it flows into the cool vestibule chamber from the
hot heating chamber. Written burn-in instructions for the spe-
cific furnace will outline the specific sequence to follow for
burn-in. The following burn-in procedure for a Type II fur-
nace is provided as one example:

(1) Atmosphere gas is introduced into the hot heating cham-
ber and auto-ignites. Ignition is visually verified, and the
inner heating chamber door is closed.

(2) A port in the closed inner door allows the atmosphere gas
to flow from the heating chamber to the vestibule cham-
ber. A manual torch placed at this port ignites the atmo-
sphere gas.

(3) Once ignition is visually verified at the inner door port,
the manual torch is removed and the outer vestibule door
is closed, and the vestibule is allowed to burn-in.

(4) Burn-in of the vestibule is visually confirmed once a steady
flame appears at the vestibule atmosphere effluent vent.

Α.13.5.11.7.6 To avoid adverse effects on the special atmo-
sphere in the heat zone and vestibule, the heating chamber
fan is turned off when the inner door is open. One adverse
effect could be the creation of atmosphere flow in the vesti-
bule, that could draw in air around the steel-to-steel contact
between the vestibule door and the furnace shell. Also, during
initial furnace burn-in, the operator typically will be instructed
to visually verify ignition of the special atmosphere gas as it is
introduced to the heating chamber. That requires both the
heating chamber door and the vestibule door to be open and
the heating chamber fan to be off to allow visual observation.

Α.13.5.11.7.7 During burn-in, cooling zone fans are to be
turned off to avoid disrupting the flame front burning





2015 Edition NFPA


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

86-110 OVENS AND FURNACES

through the cooling chamber. If a furnace is being heated, the
heat zone fans typically need to be kept in service to avoid
thermal damage. In a cooling chamber, the only ignition
source is the flame front, which is easily disrupted by fan circu-
lation. In a heating chamber above 1400°F (760°C), the entire
environment is an ignition source, and fans will not adversely
affect the reliability of ignition.

Α.13.5.11.7.8(B) The retort or inner cover of a Type VIII fur-
nace and the cover of a Type IX furnace will be sealed to the
base. Sand seals, oil seals, or rubber seals can be used.

A.13.5.11.7.8(C) The means to maintain furnace pressure be-
low the static head pressure of the seal oil include the use of
bubblers or manometers on vent lines. Other means may be
possible. Also see A.13.5.11.1 (Ε).

A.13.5.11.7.10 The character of the flame at furnace open
ends and special atmosphere effluents will be a function of the
specific furnace. It is essential that the furnace operator be
trained to recognize the "established character" of these
flames. In addition, the operator should be aware of the typi-
cal timing for flame to appear at open ends and effluent vents.
Furnaces, such as heating-cover types, that have no open
ends, doors, or effluent lines will have no features to provide
indicators of visible flame. This is an acceptable arrangement
and is addressed by the specific furnace design and operating
instructions.

Α.13.5.11.8.1(A) Purge effectiveness can be compromised by
actions such as operating furnace doors, operating quench
elevators, introducing work, and operating fans not included
in the purge process. Purge effectiveness can also be compro-
mised by not running the fans required to effect the purge.
Avoiding such actions should be addressed by written operat-
ing procedures or by interlocks.

Α.13.5.11.8.3 Oxidizing special atmosphere gases include air.

A.13.5.11.8.4 The furnace volume includes chambers, zones,
covers, and retorts that contain the flammable special atmo-
sphere within the furnace. Ductwork associated with recircu-
lating fans such as jet coolers is considered part of the furnace
volume, as is the space in the furnace steel shell but above the
refractory arch if flammable special atmosphere gas can per-
meate into that space. Flammable special atmosphere gases
such as hydrogen may migrate into an above-arch space dur-
ing operation and may require special purging facilities to re-
move them during the purge-out process.

A.13.5.11.8.5 Chambers include heating chamber, cooling
chambers, vestibules, door housings, and other atmosphere
containing volumes that would create a hazard if not specifi-
cally purged.

A.13.5.11.9.1(A) Burn-out effectiveness can be compromised
by actions that are not included in the burn-out operating
instructions. Furnace doors, quench elevators, and fans
should not be operated except in accordance with written
burn-out operating instructions. Work should not be intro-
duced into a furnace during the burn-out process. Burn-out
effectiveness can also be compromised by not running fans
required to effect the burn-out.

A.13.5.11.9.1(B) Typically, where doors are present, the
burnout procedure will begin with all inner and outer doors
closed. The outermost chamber will be burned-out first.

A.13.5.11.9.2 Burn-out can be accomplished by introducing
air by a number of means, including open ends, vents, open-
ing doors, header and feed pipes of burnout manifold sys-
tems, process air piping, and so forth. Uncontrolled admission
of air can lead to excessive temperatures in some furnaces.
Opening doors can create a draft through a furnace that can
push ignited atmosphere out other openings, and instructions
should be carefully developed to avoid such conditions. The
written procedures required in 13.5.11.9.1 should provide
step-by-step instructions for a controlled burn-out.
With hot furnaces that contain soot, it is possible to re-form
a flammable atmosphere that may require additional air intro-
duction procedures to effect final burn-out.

A.13.5.11.9.3 For Type IX furnaces (cover), visual observa-
tion of burn-out is not possible until the cover is removed.
Written burn-out procedures will typically include the follow-
ing actions:

(1) Release the mechanical clamping devices holding the
heating cover to the base.
(2) Ignite the manual burn-off pilots or torches and place
them in position at the heating cover to the base seal to
ignite flammable gases that might be present inside the
cover as the seal is broken.

Α.13.5.11.9.3(2)(a) The requirement for the furnace to be
under positive pressure is to eliminate the concern that an
indeterminate atmosphere might develop in furnace cham-
bers under 1400°F (760°C). With some furnace burn-out pro-
cedures (e.g., opening doors), initiating the burn-out can
cause the furnace pressure to immediately fall to atmospheric
pressure. This is not an issue once the burn-out procedure has
been initiated.

A.13.5.11.9.6 During burn-out, fans are to be turned off to
avoid disrupting the flame front burning back through to the
special atmosphere gas source.

A.13.5.11.10 See Figure A.13.5.11.10.

A.13.5.11.10.2.1 One of the following secondary equipment
isolation means should be provided immediately downstream
of the equipment isolation manual shutoff valve so that no
leakage of gas passing the equipment isolation manual shutoff
valve can enter the downstream special atmosphere piping:

(1) Removable spool piece
(2) Breakable flanges with loosely inserted blinding plate
(3) Blinding plate secured between flanges
(4) A second valve with venting of the intermediate space be-
tween this valve and the special atmosphere manual isola-
tion valve

Two manual shutoff valves in series without venting of the
intermediate space would not be considered equivalent to the
above choices.

Α.13.5.11.10.3(B) See A.6.2.6.3.

A.13.5.11.10.3(D) Vent line sizing in accordance with
13.5.11.10.3 is intended to avoid the operation of individual
devices from affecting (cross-impulsing) other manifolded de-
vices under normal operations. Under upset conditions in
which a device diaphragm fails, the vent line will direct the
release gas to a suitable location, but it would not necessarily
avoid adverse control impact upon other manifolded devices.
It should be noted that special atmosphere gases typically op-
erate at low pressure and utilize regulators with large dia-
phragms that are more sensitive to pressure pulses across in-
terconnected vent lines.

Α.13.5.11.10.4(A) Typically, relief valves would not be pro-
vided for generated special atmosphere gases. Relief valves
might not be needed for enriching gas where the fuel gas
supply to the furnace is equipped with multiple pressure regu-
lators and where the failure of any one pressure regulator
would not introduce excessive pressures to the special atmo-
sphere system downstream of the failed pressure regulator.
Relief valves might be needed for liquid special atmospheres
or special atmosphere gases provided from pressurized stor-
age vessels.

A.13.5.11.10.4(B) Overpresurization of the liquid special at-
mosphere piping can occur if liquid is isolated in the piping
between closed valves and exposed to an increase in tempera-
ture. Closed valves can include manual valves, automatic
valves, or safety shutoff valves. Other means of controlling
pressure could include an accumulator or an expansion tank.

A.13.5.11.10.4(C) See A.6.2.6.3. Also, for atmosphere gases
supplied in the liquid state, relief valves can be piped back to
the liquid storage vessel.

A.13.5.11.10.8 Atmosphere impingement on the tempera-
ture control thermocouple can result in overheating of the
furnace or erroneous control readings on the over tempera-
ture thermocouple.

Α.13.5.11.11.8 The means can be either electrical or me-
chanical. Mechanical means would include the operation of
valves in the special atmosphere piping. For some applica-
tions, additional manual action might be required to bring the
process to a safe condition.

A.13.5.11.11.10(A) The removal of flammable special atmo-
spheres by burn-out, purge-out, or emergency purge-out can be
caused by manual or automatic action. Table A.13.5.11.11.10(A)
summarizes when the action should be automatic and when it
can be automatic or manual.


Table A.13.5.11.11.10(A) Burnout, Purge-out, and
Emergency Purge-out Conditions and Responses

| Part | Condition | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Normal furnace atmosphere burn-out initiated | Automatic or manual |
| 2 | Normal furnace atmosphere purge-out initiated | Automatic or manual |
| 3 | Low flow of carrier gas (es) that will not maintain a positive pressure in chambers below 1400°F (760°C) and positive pressure is not restored by the automatic transfer to another source of gas | Automatic |
| 4 | A furnace temperature below which any liquid carrier gas used will not reliably dissociate | Automatic |
| 5 | Automatic emergency inert gas purge initiated | Automatic |
| 6 | Manual operator emergency inert gas purge initiated | Automatic |


Part 3 addresses the condition where there is a low flow of
carrier gas that will not maintain positive pressure within a
chamber that is below 1400°F (760°C). If a chamber is above
1400°F (760°C), the low flow condition might allow furnace
pressure to drop and might allow air infiltration; however,
while this might lead to process issues, it is not a safety issue
requiring the removal of the special atmosphere. Following
operating instructions, the operator can work to restore nor-
mal process conditions.

It should be noted that Part 3 does not involve any measure-
ment of the actual furnace pressure. Rather, it is based on com-
paring the actual carrier gas(es) flow with minimum allowable
design flow rates. The actual carrier gas flow is measured with
flow sensors. Furnace pressure is subject to fluctuation due to
actions such as operating doors and loading or unloading work.
The inadvertent shutdown of carrier gases due to a routine fur-
nace pressure fluctuation is considered more of a potential safety
hazard than the actual pressure fluctuation itself.

A.13.5.11.11.11(B) Where exothermic generated special atmo-
sphere gases are used for purging, the flammable content of the
gas is maintained at a limited level that when mixed with air
would not exceed 25 percent of LFL and therefore would not
need a safety shutoff valve. See 13.5.5.1 (D) (2) for further guid-
ance on monitoring of purge gases for flammable components.

A.13.5.11.11.11 (E) See A.7.4.9.

A.13.5.11.11.12(D) Normal shutdown of a furnace by burn-
out is an example of a practice that causes a furnace chamber
to lose positive pressure. However, this loss of positive pressure
takes place along with the controlled introduction of air to
effect the burn-out of the flammable atmosphere. Safety shut-
off valves are to close in response to this action, but there is no
safety issue with this intended case of furnace pressure loss.

The unintended interruption of a furnace heating system,
unintended loss of furnace temperature, unintended reduc-
tion of carrier gas flow, or unintended interruption of power
are examples of conditions that can cause furnace chambers
to lose positive pressure. These conditions, however, can lead
to the uncontrolled infiltration of air into furnace chambers,
which could rapidly lead to an unsafe condition (faster than
operators might be able to respond) in some of or all the
chambers. Chamber temperature will influence whether an
unsafe condition can develop.

Where chamber temperature is at or above 1400°F (760°C),
the uncontrolled air infiltration could create process quality is-
sues; however, it is not anticipated to create safety issues. This
standard has no requirement to initiate the removal of the spe-
cial atmosphere in this case. Instead, the operator should follow
written operating instructions and work to restore normal pro-
cess conditions. The written operating instructions could include
directions to implement a controlled furnace shutdown if certain
specified conditions develop.

Where chamber temperature is below 1400°F (760°C), the
uncontrolled air infiltration could create an explosion hazard.
Under these conditions, the safety shutoff valves for flam-
mable special atmospheres will close, and the actions specified
in 13.5.11.11.10(B) (1) should automatically occur.

Regarding A.13.5.11.11.12(D) (4), where a carrier gas gen-
erated by liquid dissociation is used, furnace temperatures
need to be maintained above a temperature that will maintain
reliable dissociation of the liquid. In earlier editions of
NFPA 86, the minimum temperature was stated as 800°F
(427°C). This specific value has been removed from the stan-
dard because there is more than one liquid used as a special
atmosphere, and each liquid should be evaluated for the mini-
mum temperature that will reliably dissociate that liquid in the
furnace. Where a reliable dissociation temperature is not
maintained, the special atmosphere liquid might no longer
maintain a positive furnace pressure. Once positive furnace
pressure is lost, air infiltration will be possible, and a furnace
explosion hazard can develop.

A.13.5.11.11.15 Vestibule explosion relief means usually con-
sist of doors that remain in position under their own weight
but are otherwise unrestrained from moving away from the
door opening if an overpressure occurs within the furnace.

A.13.5.11.11.16 Noncarrier special atmosphere gases can be
flammable (e.g., enriching gas) or nonflammable (e.g., pro-
cess air). Their introduction into the furnace should occur
only after the carrier gases flow has been established. Accord-
ing to this standard, flammable special atmosphere gases are
equipped with safety shutoff valves. Nonflammable special at-
mosphere gases typically are equipped with solenoid valves.

A.13.5.12 The following paragraphs provide additional infor-
mation with regard to purge effectiveness.

Verifying Purge Effectiveness by Gas Analysis. Historically, gas
analyses have been required to verify when a purge has satis-
factorily diluted the oxygen or combustible gas inside a fur-
nace. Accordingly, gas analyzing instruments are included
among the protective equipment required to operate furnaces
that employ flammable processing atmospheres. Verification
is needed because of concerns about the efficacy of a purge
due to the following:

(1) Difficulties in purging all parts of a furnace
(2) Purge not actually flowing into a furnace as intended

(3) Air leakage into a furnace through faulty seals around
openings
(4) Air leaks into the purge gas piping
(5) Unreliable flow rate or timing measurements

Gas analysis has been the accepted method for verifying
the effectiveness of a purge. Usually it is a measurement of
oxygen or combustible gas concentration in the gas being ex-
hausted from the furnace. Purge effluent gases from furnaces
often contain condensed oil and water vapors, soot, and lubri-
cant decomposition products. These materials can clog or ac-
cumulate inside sample collection tubing and cause mislead-
ing analysis results. They can foul or damage instrument
sensors. Consequently, most analyses are manual spot checks
made by an operator using portable instruments.

Manual analyses do not lend themselves to modern, auto-
mated atmosphere control systems. Instead, instruments that
continuously analyze sample streams are preferred. Unfortu-
nately, they suffer from the sample conditioning problems
mentioned and often do not provide the reliability needed.

*Timed Flow Purge Method.* Measured dilution purging is also a
dependable method for accomplishing a successful purge. Be-
cause its results are certain and accurately predictable, its effec-
tiveness does not need to be verified by using gas analyzers, pro-
vided that the equipment, the purge gas, and the operating
procedures are not altered when future purges are performed.
Therefore, a standardized timed flow rate measurement can be
relied on to perform without resorting to repetitive gas analyses
during routine operations of the furnace.

*Dilution Purging.* In dilution purging, the diluent gas is
added continuously to a furnace or vessel to lower the concen-
tration of the component to be purged. The vent stream is also
continuous. For example, air or the oxygen portion of air is
purged out of a furnace using an oxygen-free purge gas. The
greater the volume of purge gas used in relation to the volume
of the purged vessel, the lower the resultant oxygen content.
In most cases, the final oxygen concentration is independent
of purge time duration. Rather, it is a function of the volume
of the container and the total volume of nitrogen introduced.

*Determining Gas Purge Requirements.* Figure A.13.5.12 illustrates
how the concentration of oxygen in an air-filled furnace drops as
nitrogen is introduced (note vertical scale on the right beginning
at 20.9 percent oxygen in air). Five furnace volume changes re-
duce the oxygen content to about 0.1 percent volume.

The vertical scale on the left of Figure A.13.5.12 can be
used to predict how much nitrogen is needed to lower the
concentration of combustible gases below desired limits. For
example, to decrease the hydrogen content of a 10 percent
H₂ gas mixture to less than 0.1 percent, five furnace volume
changes are needed (seven volume changes minus two volume
changes on the horizontal scale).

*Limitations of Dilution Purging Technique.* It is important to
note that the dilution purge technique depends on uniform
mixing of the atmosphere in the furnace or vessel during the
purge period. This technique is not predictable if the gas cir-
culation fans fail or if they are incapable of creating a homo-
geneous mixture throughout the furnace at the diluent flow
rate used. Therefore, the time needed to conduct a dilution
purge of a given furnace installation can be influenced by the
purge gas flow rate. In a furnace equipped with a low capacity
circulation fan, the purge gas flow rate might have to be lim-
ited to ensure that the diluent gas is dispersed effectively
throughout the purged chamber as the purge proceeds. This
is not likely to be a problem, provided the diluent flow rate is
not radically higher than the normal atmosphere flow rate.

The graph shows an exponentially decreasing trend, indicating that as the number of volume changes increases, the concentration of the original atmosphere remaining in the chamber decreases.

FIGURE A.13.5.12 Determining Purge Effectiveness.

*Troubleshooting Faulty Purge Trials.* If a dilution purging trial
fails to duplicate the theoretical result predicted by Fig-
ure A.13.5.12, it is a sign that one or more of the following condi-
tions exist:

(1) The gas flow or time measurement is faulty.
(2) The purge gas is contaminated with the gas being purged.
(3) The purge gas supplying the piping or the furnace has
leaks and is aspirating air into the system.
(4) The atmosphere circulation within the furnace is inad-
equate.
(5) The purge gas is not flowing through the furnace.
(6) The gas analysis is faulty.

Inert gas purges are used for either of the following purposes:

(1) To remove oxygen (contained in air) from a furnace before
introducing a flammable or indeterminate carrier gas
(2) To remove a flammable or indeterminate atmosphere
from the furnace before it is opened to the air

Such purges are required to avoid creating explosive
atmosphere-air mixtures inside the furnace when combus-
tible gases are introduced or withdrawn or when a furnace is
opened to the air.

A.13.5.12.1 Because purging without atmosphere circulation
can leave pockets of combustible gases inside a furnace, the
presence of a flammable gas might not be detectable by ana-
lyzing the vent gas. Further, timed flow purging is not reliable
for determining when an inert purge is complete.

A.13.5.12.3 Examples of alterations that could reduce purge
effectiveness include the following:

(1) Revised atmosphere inlet or vent piping
(2) Changes or replacements of atmosphere flow controls
and metering equipment
(3) Revised operating procedures
(4) Changes to the furnace, atmosphere gas, or atmosphere
process
(5) Maintenance or repairs on the furnace system, including
entry doors and seals

A.13.5.13.6 Quench medium tanks generally utilize a cooling system that maintains the quench medium at an operating temperature that reduces the quantity of quench medium re- quired. Three basic cooling systems are in general use and consist of the following:

(1) An internal cooler, where a heat transfer medium is circu- lated through a heat exchanger within the quench tank

(2) An external cooler, where a quench medium is withdrawn from a quench tank, circulated through a liquid-cooled heat exchanger, and returned

(3) An external cooler, where a quench medium is withdrawn from a quench tank, circulated through an air-cooled heat exchanger, and returned

A.13.5.13.7 Quench oil should be checked for water content wherever there is a possibility of water intrusion into the oil supply or oil systems. Typical situations include the following:

(1) The quench system was idle for a long period of time.

(2) The quench oil was transferred in temporary storage con- tainers.

(3) A nearby sprinkler system was activated.

(4) The roof leaked.

(5) The water-oil heat exchanger leaked.

Bulk oil storage systems should be checked for water peri- odically. Quench oil that operates below 212°F (100°C) should be checked for water content periodically.

A.13.5.13.7.5(A) The hot plate laboratory method test con- sists of dropping a few drops of quench oil sample on a hot, flat, metal plate with a temperature of 225°F to 275°F (107°C to 135°C). If the fluid snaps and spatters when it contacts the hot plate, water is present. If the oil becomes thin and smokes, no water is present. This method does not determine the per- centage of water, only the presence of water. If a quantitative analysis is performed, the water content in the quench oil should not exceed 0.5 percent by volume.

Α.13.5.13.7.5(B) The sampling procedure should consider the most likely location where water occurs. Water does not mix easily with quench oil, and water is heavier than oil. In some quench systems, the quench oil should be agitated, all pumps should be operated for a period of time, and the oil then should be left still for a time before the sample is re- moved from the lowest floor of the quench tank. In other quench systems, the quench oil should be well agitated and the sample removed from a turbulent region.

A.13.5.13.7.5(C) The following are examples of when con- tamination is a possibility:

(1) After a shutdown

(2) After a heat exchanger leak

(3) After any components in the oil-cooling, agitation, or re- circulation system are replaced

(4) After a water-extinguished fire in the area

(5) After a significant addition of new or used oil

A.13.5.14 Fire is the principal hazard in oil quenching. When hot metal is quenched in oil, an envelope of vapors forms around the piece. Large vapor bubbles, which can have tem- peratures above auto-ignition temperature, rise to the surface and sometimes flash into flame momentarily. Additional local- ized surface flashing also occurs around the work as the metal enters the oil but is extinguished readily by normal agitation of the oil.

There are three general types of quench oil fires that can reach serious proportions in the absence of sprinkler protec- tion. The first, most common type of fire occurs when the oil is at its normal temperature below the flash point. The red-hot work hangs up, partially submerged at the surface, heating the oil locally above its flash point. The fire develops slowly, and, if the work is promptly submerged or removed from the tank, it can be extinguished with portable extinguishing equipment or by agitating the oil.

The second type of fire occurs when the main body of oil is heated above the flash point because of failure or inadequacy of the tank's cooling system or introduction of an excessive workload. This type of fire reaches full intensity in only a few seconds and is very difficult to extinguish with portable equip- ment. Above 212°F (100°C), the heated oil turns water to

steam. When water is discharged on the fire, the tank can ex-
perience frothover. Fire spreads suddenly over the adjacent
floor area, and fire fighters are forced back by intense heat
and smoke. (Water spray discharged from sprinklers pen-
etrates the oil surface less readily than the solid hose stream
and, consequently, causes less violent frothover.)

The third and equally serious type of fire is caused by oil
contacting the hot furnace as a result of any of the following:

(1) Overfilling the tank
(2) Splashing caused by the discharge from recirculation
nozzles under conditions of low oil level
(3) Steam formation if water gets into the tank because of
leakage from cooling coils and the temperature reaches
212°F (100°C), or if the hot work penetrates the water
layer

In open tanks, formation of steam below the surface causes
foaming and frothover. In enclosed tanks, pressure builds up
and oil or flammable furnace atmosphere shoots out of open-
ings. Intense burning can occur over a wide area.

Figure A.13.5.14 shows an example of an oil quench tank
arrangement.

Protection requirements for open quench tanks are in-
cluded in Chapter 13.

Α.13.5.14.3.2(E) A dual-set point excess temperature limit
switch arranged to actuate the alarm prior to the other opera-
tions can be used.

A.13.5.15 The potential hazards in the operation of molten
salt bath furnaces can result in explosions, fires, or both, ei-
ther inside the salt bath furnace or outside the furnace. Basic
causes can be chemical or physical reactions or a combination.
Because molten salts have high heating potential, low vis-
cosities, and relatively little surface tension, even minor physi-
cal disturbances to the molten salt bath can result in spatter-
ing or ejection of the molten salt out of the furnace container.
This ejection can become violent when liquids (e.g., water,
oil) or reactive materials are allowed to penetrate the surface
of the salt bath.

Nitrate salts can produce violent explosions because of
chemical chain reactions when the nitrate salt is overheated.

Overheating can result from a malfunction of the heating sys-
tem controls, a floating or "hung-up" workload, or an operator
processing error.

While NFPA 86 deals primarily with the protection and con-
servation of property, salt bath explosions (chemical or physi-
cal) could involve injury to personnel. As a result, it is recom-
mended that all aspects of personnel safety be investigated
thoroughly.

A.13.5.15.2.2(A) Most salts are hygroscopic.

A.13.5.15.4.1 Fume hoods are necessary to remove and ap-
propriately control the emission of heat and toxic (or other-
wise deleterious) fumes.

A.13.5.15.6.1 See Figure A.13.5.15.6.1.

Α.13.5.15.6.2(A) Free carbon or soot in contact with nitrate
salt is hazardous.

Α.13.5.15.6.3(A) Free carbon or soot in contact with nitrate
salt is hazardous.

A.13.5.15.8 Because of the potential for the spattering of the
molten salts, it is recommended that consideration be given to
the provision of heat-resistant clothing, safety glasses or
goggles, full faceshields, heat-resistant gloves, safety shoes,
and all other personnel protection recommended by the
equipment manufacturer, user standards, industrial safety
standards, and local, state, or federal requirements.

A.13.5.15.9.2 In deep, pot-type, molten salt equipment, provi-
sions should be made for keeping the upper burners fired until
the salt is melted before firing the bottom burner. In shallow,
pot-type, molten salt equipment, a solid rod or open cylinder
tube should be placed in the pot when the pot is not being used
in order to conduct heat from the bottom of the pot. This provi-
sion makes an opening in the crust and avoids eruptions.

A.14.2.2.1 Vacuum gauges might contain controlling devices
to operate equipment sequentially.

A.14.2.4.2 The furnace cooling system can include a vessel cooling system and one or more methods for cooling material in process. The systems might include gas quenching, oil quenching, or water quenching. Internal or external heat ex- changers are permitted to be used and generally require supplementary cooling. Special atmospheres might be used for cooling.

A.14.2.4.4 Consideration should be given to the provision of flow indicators or temperature gauges on exit cooling lines.

A.14.2.5 After the thermal cycle has been completed, the workload either is transferred to a gas quenching vestibule or is gas-quenched in the heating zone. Gas quenching is per- formed by the introduction of a cooling gas (usually nitrogen, hydrogen, argon, or helium) until the pressure reaches a pre- determined level [usually from a gauge pressure of 2 psi (13.8 kPa) (82.7 kPa) to a gauge pressure of 12 psi above atmo- spheric] and by recirculating the cooling gas through a heat exchanger and over the work by means of a fan or blower. The heat exchanger and fans or blower are either internal (within the furnace vacuum chamber) or external (outside the fur- nace vacuum chamber).

A.14.2.6 See Annex I for general pump information.

A.14.2.6.1 Vacuum pumps can be the ejector, liquid ring, me- chanical, cryopump, or diffusion type.

A.14.2.6.3 It is recommended that diffusion pumps be charged with a vacuum grade of silicon-based fluid to reduce the risk of explosion on inadvertent exposure to air when heated. Diffusion pump fluids with equivalent or superior fire resistance should be considered.

A.14.2.9.1 Suitable materials generally include graphite, mo- lybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, and others.

A.14.2.9.4 Where dissimilar metals are heated in contact with each other, particularly where they are oxide-free and used within a vacuum furnace, they can react and form alloys or a eutectic. The result is an alloy that melts at a considerably lower temperature than the melting point of either base metal.

Critical melting temperatures of some eutectic-forming mate- rials are listed in Table A.14.2.9.4. Operating temperatures near or above these points should be considered carefully.

A.14.2.10 The heat energy produced by the heating elements
transfers into the work principally by means of radiation and
through the insulation or heat shields into the cooled walls of
the vacuum vessel. The cooling medium is continually circu-
lated through the walls of the vessel, maintaining a cold wall.
Generally, water is used as the cooling medium.

wool, alumina-silica fibers, and other materials.

chanical gauges operate on a differential between atmo-
spheric and process pressure. They are compensated for atmo-
spheric pressure changes and calibrated for absolute pressure
units. They are not suited for high vacuum work, being limited
to approximately 1 mm Hg (133 Pa) absolute. Readout is ap-
proximately linear except when calibrated in altitude units.
Electrical output is available.

McLeod Gauge. For high vacuum work, the McLeod gauge is
often used as a primary standard for the calibration of other,
more easily used instruments. The gauge is limited to intermit-
tent sampling rather than continuous use. It operates on the
principle of compressing a large known volume (V₁) of gas at
unknown system pressure (P₁) into a much smaller volume (V₂)
at a known higher pressure (P₂), as derived from Boyle's law, at
constant temperature. The gauge then is calibrated to read P₁.

*Thermal Gauges.* The operation of a thermal gauge is based
on the theory that energy dissipated from a hot surface is pro-
portional to the pressure of the surrounding gas. Some manu-
facturers produce thermal gauges that are subject to contami-
nation by vaporized materials, and this issue should be
discussed with the gauge manufacturer. The following are
types of thermal gauges:

(1) *Thermocouple Gauge.* The thermocouple gauge contains a
V-shaped filament with a small thermocouple attached to
the point. At low absolute pressures, the cooling effect on
the heated filament is proportional to the pressure of the
surrounding gas. Therefore, the thermocouple electromag-
netic field (emf) can be used to indicate pressure. To com-
pensate for ambient temperature, an identical second unit is
sealed in an evacuated tube. The differential output of the
two thermocouples is proportional to the pressure.

(2) *Pirani Gauge.* The Pirani gauge employs a Wheatstone
bridge circuit. This circuit balances the resistance of a
tungsten filament sealed off in high vacuum against that
of a tungsten filament that can lose heat to the gas being
measured by means of conduction. In the Pirani gauge,
the resistance of the filament, rather than its tempera-
ture, is used as an indication of pressure.

(3) *Bimetal Gauge.* A bimetallic spiral is heated by a stabilized
power source. Any change of pressure causes a change of
temperature and, therefore, a deflection of the spiral,
which is linked to a pointer on a scale that indicates
pressure.

*Ionization Gauges.* The two types of ionization gauges are
the hot filament (hot cathode) gauge and the cold cathode
(Phillips or discharge) gauge. Their principle of operation is
based on the fact that collisions between molecules and elec-
trons result in the formation of ions. The rate of ion formation
varies directly with pressure. Measurement of the ion current
can be translated into units of gas pressure. The two types of
ionization gauges are as follows:

(1) *Hot Filament (Hot Cathode) Gauge.* This gauge is con-
structed like an electron tube. It has a tungsten filament
surrounded by a coil grid, which in turn is surrounded by
a collector plate. Electrons emitted from the heated fila-
ment are accelerated toward the positively charged coil
grid. The accelerated electrons pass through the coil grid
into the space between the grid and the negatively
charged collector plate. Some electrons collide with gas
molecules from the vacuum system to produce positive
ions. The positive current is a function of the number of
ions formed and therefore a measure of the pressure of
the system. Ionization gauge-sensing elements are ex-
tremely delicate and should be handled carefully. Their
filaments can burn out if accidentally exposed to pres-
sures above 1 × 10-3 mm Hg (1.3 × 10-¹ Pa) absolute. The
advantages of this type of gauge are high sensitivity and
the ability to measure extremely high vacuums.

(2) *Cold Cathode (Phillips or Discharge) Gauge.* A cold cathode
gauge employs the principle of the measurement of an
ion current produced by a discharge of high voltage. Elec-
trons from the cathode of the sensing element are caused
to spiral as they move across a magnetic field to the an-
ode. With this spiraling, the electron mean-free path
greatly exceeds the distance between electrodes. There-
fore, the possibility of a collision with the gas molecules
present is increased, producing greater sensitivity (due to
greater ion current) and thus sustaining the cathode dis-
charge at lower pressure (i.e., high vacuum).

The sensing elements are rugged and well suited to pro-
duction applications where unskilled help might make fila-
ment burnout a problem.

A.14.5.1.4 Providing automatic valves would help prevent
pump oil or air from passing through the system or causing
damage to the furnace or load.

A.14.5.1.6 An example warning label reads as follows:

WARNING: Do not open oil drain or fill plugs for service until
pump heater is at room temperature. Otherwise, ignition of
pump oil can occur with rapid expansion of gas, causing dam-
age to the pump and furnace hot zone.

A.14.5.1.7.1 The formation of steam pockets can cause an
explosion.

A.14.5.1.7.2 If the electron beam becomes fixed on one spot,
burn-through of a water circuit could occur.

A.14.5.1.7.5 Accelerating voltages run as high as 100 kV and
present a shock or X-ray hazard.

A.14.5.2.1 Integral liquid quench systems might be con-
structed within the furnace vacuum chamber or might be in
quench vestibules separated from the heating portion of the
chamber with a door or vacuum-tight valve. Semicontinuous
furnaces employ valves on each end of the hot vacuum zone.

86-118 OVENS AND FURNACES

These furnaces might be divided into three separate cham-
bers: a loading vestibule, a hot vacuum chamber, and a cool-
ing vestibule. With this arrangement, cooling or pressurizing
the hot vacuum chamber is not required for loading and un-
loading. Cooling vestibules are often equipped with elevators
so that loads can be quenched by vacuum, gas, or oil.

A.14.5.2.2.2 Although carbon steel plate was been used for
many years with water cooling, its use is no longer permitted,
because corrosion is continuous and the extent of it is difficult
to determine. In existing installations where carbon steel has
been used with water-based coolants, the wall thickness should
be tested periodically to determine the corrosion rate and pre-
dict the remaining life.

A.14.5.2.4.1 Quench medium tanks generally utilize a cool-
ing system to maintain the quench medium at an operating
temperature to reduce the quantity of quench media re-
quired. The three basic cooling systems in general use consist
of the following:

(1) Internal cooler, where a heat transfer medium is circu-
lated through a heat exchanger within the quench tank
(2) External cooler in which a quench medium is withdrawn
from a quench tank, circulated through a water-cooled
heat exchanger, and returned
(3) External cooler in which a quench medium is withdrawn
from a quench tank, circulated through an air-cooled
heat exchanger, and returned

A.14.5.2.4.2(Β) Maximum working pressure should include
allowance for vacuum conditions.

A.14.5.2.4.3(Β) Maximum working pressure should include
allowance for vacuum conditions.

A.14.5.2.6.11(A) The hot plate laboratory method test con-
sists of dropping a few drops of quench oil sample on a hot,
flat metal plate with a temperature of 225°F to 275°F (107°C to
135°C). If the fluid snaps and spatters when it contacts the hot
plate, water is present. If the oil becomes thin and smokes, no
water is present. This method does not determine the percent-
age of water, only the presence of water. If a quantitative analy-
sis of the water is performed, the water content of the oil
should not exceed 0.5 percent by volume.

A.14.5.2.6.11(B) The sampling procedure should consider
the location where water is most likely to occur. Water does not
mix easily with quench oil, and water is heavier than oil. In
some quench systems, the quench oil should be agitated, all
pumps should be operated for a period of time, and the oil
then should be left still for a time before the sample is re-
moved from the lowest floor of the quench tank. In other
quench systems, the quench oil should be well agitated and
the sample removed from a turbulent region.

A.14.5.2.6.11 (C) The following are examples of when con-
tamination is a possibility:

(1) After a shutdown
(2) After a heat exchanger leak
(3) After any components in the oil-cooling, agitation, or re-
circulation system are replaced
(4) After a water-extinguished fire in the area
(5) After a significant addition of new or used oil

A.14.5.3.1.6 If a residual amount of air is retained in an ex-
ternal chamber, the inadvertent opening of a valve to an exter-
nal system in the presence of a flammable atmosphere could
create an explosive mixture.

A.14.5.3.1.12 Cracking of a sight glass, which is not unusual,
can admit air into the chamber or allow flammable gas to escape.

A.14.5.3.4 In case of electric power failure, all of the follow-
ing systems could stop functioning:

(1) Heating system
(2) Flammable atmosphere gas system
(3) Vacuum pumping system

A.14.5.4 Storage systems should comply with the following
NFPA standards:

(1) Liquefied petroleum gas systems should be in accordance
with NFPA 58, *Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code*.
(2) Gas piping should be in accordance with NFPA 54, *Na-
tional Fuel Gas Code*.
(3) Hydrogen storage systems should be in accordance with
NFPA 55, *Compressed Gases and Cryogenic Fluids Code*.
(4) Oxygen storage systems shall be in accordance with
NFPA 55.

Processing atmosphere gas storage systems not covered by
an NFPA standard or code (e.g., anhydrous ammonia) should
be installed in accordance with supplier requirements and all
applicable local, state, and federal codes.

A.14.5.5.1.2 The bottom third of a water-cooled vessel of a
vacuum induction melting furnace should be trace-cooled in-
stead of jacketed in order to provide minimum water storage
in the event of a melting crucible breakthrough. The bottom
of the furnace chamber should be equipped with a separate
cooling circuit that can be valved off in the event of a molten
metal burn-through of the chamber. The quality of the cool-
ing water should be considered to minimize plugging of the
induction coil or coils and to minimize corrosion of or attack
on all water-cooled components.

A.14.5.5.2 The purpose of the power supply is to transform the
power line to a suitable voltage and current (and, where neces-
sary, to convert from 60 Hz to another frequency) to energize the
induction coil. Consideration should be given to furnishing the
power supply with a means of proportioning control.

Generally, this is accomplished with a motor generator, an
electronic oscillator, or silicon-controlled, solid-state con-
verter units. In most cases, a dc control signal is provided for
proportioning control. The design of the power supply is spe-
cific to the individual furnace and size.

The power supply can include a transformer (or a motor
generator), capacitors with control switches as necessary, a
control device such as a saturable core reactor, primary fuses
or circuit breakers for electrical protection, and an electrical
disconnect switch for service. A power controller is permitted
to be used where necessary to accept a signal from the furnace
temperature controller.

The power supply output voltage should be limited to a
maximum of 80 volts for noninsulated induction coils in order
to prevent electrical breakdown or internal furnace arcing. As
the atmospheric pressure is reduced in the vacuum chamber,
arcing voltage changes. This voltage change is a function of
electrical spacing and pressure. This function is not linear but
has a minimum value for most gases used as cooling or partial
pressure media in vacuum furnaces. If the voltage stress and
mean-free path relationship reaches a critical value, corona
discharge and arcing commence as a result of the field emis-
sion of electrons. For insulated induction coils, the operating

possible, the interlocks should be made to fail manually,
verifying that the related equipment operates as speci-
fied by the manufacturer.
(9) Test the safety shutoff valves for operation and tightness
of closure as specified by the manufacturer.
(10) Test the main fuel manual valves for operation and tight-
ness of closure as specified by the manufacturer.
(11) Test the pressure switches for proper operation at set
point.
(12) Visually inspect electrical switches, contacts, or controls
for signs of arcing or contamination.
(13) Test instruments for proper response to thermocouple
failure.

ANNEX E 86–121

This UL Bulletin of Research No. 43 reports an investiga-
tion conducted by Underwriters Laboratories Inc. to deter-
mine the lower limit of flammability (upward propagation)
and the autogenous ignition temperature of certain common
solvent vapors encountered in industrial ovens. The solvents
included acetone, iso-amyl acetate, benzene, normal butyl al-
cotlol, cyclohexane, cyclohexanone, meta or para cresol, ethyl
alcohol, ethyl lactate, gasoline, normal hexane, high solvency
petroleum naphtha, methyl alcohol, methyl ethyl ketone, me-
thyl lactate, No. 10 Mineral Spirits, toluene, turpentine, and
VM and P naphtha.

The lower limits of flammability of the solvent vapors in air
at initial temperatures encountered in the operation of ovens
were determined in a specially designed, electrically heated,
closed explosion vessel of steel having a capacity of 1 ft³
(0.028 m³) [15¼ in. (387 mm) high, 12 in. (305 mm) internal
diameter]. It was equipped with an observation window, an
externally driven mixing fan, and inlet and outlet valves. A
transformer rated 15,000 V, 60 mA, 60 cycles for the secondary
and having a 0.009 mfd condenser connected across the sec-
ondary was used to produce an electric discharge for ignition.

The lower limits of flammability of all solvents included in
this investigation were found to be lowered on increasing the
initial ambient temperature, these changes in the lower limits
being of such magnitude that they cannot be safely neglected
in practical calculations of the amount of ventilation required
to prevent formation of hazardous concentrations of the va-
pors of the solvents in industrial ovens. The magnitude of the
change in the lower limit with a given increase in initial tem-
perature varied with the different solvents.

The autogenous ignition temperature (in air) of the solvent
vapors was determined in combustion chambers of iron, stainless
steel (AISI Type No. 302), copper, zinc, and yellow brass, repre-
senting metals commonly used in oven construction. Determina-
tions in glass and quartz chambers were included for compari-
son. The autogenous ignition temperature of the solvents is
influenced to some extent by catalytic or other reactions of the
solvent vapor-air mixtures with the heated metals or their oxides.
Whether the ignition temperature of the solvent is increased or
decreased (as compared with values obtained with glass or quartz
combustion chambers) depends on the particular combinations
of solvent vapor and metals.

The ignition temperatures of solvents in metal chambers
were higher, for the most part, than the ignition temperatures
of the same solvents in glass or quartz chambers, but excep-
tions were found where the values obtained in the metal
chambers were lower (i.e., butyl alcohol in copper and brass
chambers). The autogenous ignition temperature of many sol-
vents included in the investigation is within the range of tem-
peratures encountered in industrial ovens and, if conditions
are such as to allow formation of flammable vapor-air mix-
tures in the oven, autogenous ignition can occur.

NOTE: In calculating ventilation requirements for batch
ovens operating from 250°F to 500°F (121°C to 260°C), values
for the lower flammable limit of the solvent determined at the
operating temperature of the oven should be used where such
data are available. However, where the data are obtainable
only for room temperature, a correction factor is required. An
averaged factor of 1.4 has been obtained from a graph of the
experimental data plotted for a number of selected solvents
over temperature ranges of 70°F to 250°F (21°C to 121°C)
(1.25) and 250°F to 500°F (121°C to 260°C) (1.56).

Annex E Continuous Solvent Vapor Concentration
Indicator and Controller

This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document
but is included for informational purposes only.

E.1 Solvent Vapor Analyzer Systems. A solvent vapor concen-
tration indicator is a measurement system that determines the
solvent vapor concentration in a Class A oven, expressed as a
percentage of the lower flammable limit (LFL), also called the
lower explosive limit (LEL). It is required for safe operation of
ovens at solvent concentrations above 25 percent LFL. The mea-
surement system consists of three integral parts, as follows:

(1) The gas sample system that delivers the oven atmosphere
sample to the analyzer
(2) The solvent vapor concentration analyzer
(3) The safety logic system that is activated by the analyzer

The oven atmosphere should be sampled at a point that
best represents the average concentration of solvent vapor in
the oven or oven zone. This usually is at the oven exhaust
point. Care should be taken to provide sufficient turbulence
within the oven to avoid significant pockets of high solvent
concentration. The sample system consists of a sample pickup
tube, sample line, sample pump, and filter or other sample
conditioning devices. The volume of the sample system should
be as small as possible, and the sample flow rate should be
maximized for fast response of the system. Special precau-
tions, such as heating the sample lines and analyzer to prevent
condensation of volatiles in the sample system, might be re-
quired. The length of the sample line should be minimized by
locating the analyzer close to the sample point.

The solvent vapor concentration analyzer can be one of
several types. The choice of the appropriate type depends on
factors such as the solvent composition, the need for calibra-
tion of more than one solvent, the necessary response time of
the measurement system, and the ability to handle factors
such as contaminants and oxygen content. The types of analyz-
ers used are described as follows:

(1) *Catalytic Combustion.* Combustion of solvent vapor occurs
on a heated catalyst surface, such as a platinum wire. The
heat of combustion causes a change in electrical resis-
tance, which is calibrated in terms of percent LFL. Be-
cause the measurement is based on combustion, the cali-
bration does vary significantly for different solvents.
However, contamination of the catalyst with silicones can
cause a calibration shift.
(2) *Infrared.* The sample is passed through a measurement
cell where infrared energy is absorbed by the solvent va-
por and compared with the energy absorbed in a refer-
ence cell containing background gas. Contamination by
silicone is not a problem with this type of analyzer, but the
calibration is specific to certain classes of solvents and var-
ies considerably for various solvent types. Its area of appli-
cation is for single solvent systems where silicone poison-
ing might be a problem.
(3) *Flame Temperature.* This is a combustion-type analyzer in
which solvent vapor in the sample is burned as it passes
through a chamber containing a small, constantly burn-
ing flame. A temperature sensor is located immediately
above the flame. The temperature varies with the amount
of solvent burned in the flame and is calibrated in percent
LFL. Contamination by silicones is not a problem, and
calibration is relatively constant for various solvents.
(4) *Flame Ionization.* Ionization of solvent vapor in contact with a
hydrogen flame causes a change in electrical properties that

86-122 OVENS AND FURNACES

is measured and calibrated in percent LFL. This method
also is used to measure very low concentrations of solvent
vapor. Very rapid response could be obtained, but the cali-
bration varies for some types of solvents.

All of the various types of analyzers are to be routinely cali-
brated using zero and span gas. Standards require initial cali-
bration for the specific solvents being measured.

The safety logic system involves high limit contacts in the
analyzer or recorder, or both, that stop the conveyor or other
means of solvent introduction and actuate dampers or fan mo-
tor drives to provide maximum makeup air and exhaust.
Other parts of the analyzer logic system include flowmeters
and pressure switches to verify the proper operation of the
sample system. The solvent vapor concentration analyzer also
can be utilized to control the percent LFL in the oven by
modulation of the makeup air or exhaust.

It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the solvent vapor
concentration measurement system is to have a very fast re-
sponse time so that corrective action will be taken in response
to upsets such as excessive introduction of solvent into the
oven. A response time of as little as 5 seconds might be re-
quired in some cases.

E.2 LFL Values and Calibration Concerns. Proper operation
of a continuous solvent vapor concentration analyzer requires
careful calibration for the correct LFL values of the particular
solvent or solvent mixtures and for response of the analyzer to
the particular solvents.

E.2.1 LFL Values and Temperature Corrections. LFL values for
many commonly used solvents are given in Table A.11.6.8.4(a)
and Table A.11.6.8.4(b). Additional data can be found in
NFPA 325, Fire-Hazard Properties of Flammable Liquids, Gases and
Volatile Solids. (Note: Although NFPA 325 has been officially with-
drawn from the National Fire Codes, the information is still avail-
able in NFPA's Fire Protection Guide to Hazardous Materials.)

For mixtures of solvents, the LFL of the mixture is calcu-
lated by the following formula:

$$LFL \text{ mixture } = \frac{100}{(P_1/L_1)+(P_2/L_2)+···(P_n/L_n)}$$  [E.2.1]

where:
$P_{1, 2, ..., n}$ = % by volume of component 1, 2, ..., n
$L_{1, 2, ..., n}$ = LFL value of each solvent

E.2.2 Instrument Calibration Factors. The solvent vapor ana-
lyzer systems described in Section E.1 respond differently to
various solvent vapors. Instrument calibration to the specific
solvent vapor or solvent mixture vapor is required both before
initial operation of the instrument and on some routine
schedule after initial operation.

E.2.2.1 Initial Calibration. The instrument should be cali-
brated initially with the solvent vapor or solvent mixture vapor
used in the oven application. A label describing this calibra-
tion should be affixed to the instrument. A permanent record
of this calibration should be included with records for the
instrument.

The user should understand how the instrument responds
to vapors for which the instrument is not calibrated, including
other solvent vapors or mixtures of solvent vapors present in
the sample and vapors whose relative response data are not
known. The instrument manufacturer should be consulted for
guidance in such cases.

The initial calibration should be based on worst-case con-
siderations, including the following:

(1) If a variety or mixture of solvent vapors is to be present,
the instrument should be calibrated for the solvent vapor
that produces the lowest instrument signal. All other sol-
vent vapors should indicate a meter value greater than the
actual concentration, so that any error in reading is always
in a safe or early warning direction.

(2) Solvent mixtures containing minor components can be
calibrated without the minor components where the esti-
mated error produced is less than 3 percent of the meter
reading.

(3) When calculating the LFL value and oven temperature
correction as provided in Table 11.6.8.3(A), the maxi-
mum oven temperature should be used.

E.2.2.2 Field Calibration. Solvent vapor analyzer systems re-
quire field calibration checks during normal operation to
verify the accuracy of the system. The manufacturer should
supply the user with a recommended schedule for calibration
checks. This schedule should be contained in the operating
instructions for the specific instrument used.

It is recommended that field calibrations be made using a
known concentration of the actual solvent vapor present in
the process.

Field calibration also can be performed using a known con-
centration of reference test gas in situations where use of the
actual solvent vapor present is not possible. This reference test
gas could be used as a substitute for the actual solvent vapor,
and meter reading adjustments can be made based on test gas
response data supplied by the instrument manufacturer.

The use of relative response data in making field calibra-
tion checks is not recommended.

Certain materials, including but not limited to silicones,
sulfur compounds, phosphorus compounds, chlorinated com-
pounds, and halogenated hydrocarbons, have a poisoning or
inhibiting effect on some solvent vapor analyzers. These mate-
rials produce a loss in sensitivity in certain instruments. If the
presence of desensitizing materials in the sample is known or
suspected, instrument field calibration checks should be per-
formed on a more frequent basis. The instrument manufac-
turer should be consulted for guidance on calibration fre-
quency in these situations.

Annex F Steam Extinguishing Systems

*This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document but is included for informational purposes only.*

F.1 General. Steam extinguishes fire by the exclusion of air or
the reduction of the oxygen content of the atmosphere in a
manner similar to that of carbon dioxide or other inert gases.
The use of steam precedes other modern smothering systems.
Steam is not a practical extinguishing agent except where a
large steam supply is continuously available. The possible burn
hazard should be considered in any steam extinguishing in-
stallation. A visible cloud of condensed vapor, popularly de-
scribed as steam, is incapable of extinguishment.

Although many fires have been extinguished by steam, its
use often has been unsuccessful due to lack of understanding
of its limitations. Except for specialized applications, other
types of smothering systems are preferred in modern practice.
No complete standard covering steam smothering systems has
yet been developed.

![NFPA logo] 2015 Edition

ANNEX G
86-123

One pound of saturated steam at 212°F (100°C) and nor- mal atmospheric pressure has a volume of 26.75 ft³ (0.76 m³). A larger percentage of steam is required to prevent combus- tion than in the case of other inert gases used for fire extin- guishment. Fires in substances that form glowing coals are dif- ficult to extinguish with steam, owing to the lack of cooling effect. For some types of fire, such as fires involving ammo- nium nitrate and similar oxidizing materials, steam is com- pletely ineffective.

Steam smothering systems should be permitted only where oven temperatures exceed 225°F (107°C) and where large supplies of steam are available at all times while the oven is in operation. Complete standards paralleling those for other ex- tinguishing agents have not been developed for the use of steam as an extinguishing agent, and, until this is done, the use of this form of protection is not as dependable, nor are the results as certain, as those provided by water, carbon dioxide, dry chemical, or foam.

Release devices for steam smothering systems should be manual, and controls should be arranged to close down oven outlets to the extent practicable.

F.2 Life Hazard.

F.2.1 Equipment should be arranged to prevent operating of steam valves when doors of box-type ovens or access doors or panels of conveyor ovens are open.

F.2.2 Aseparate outside steam manual shutoff valve should be provided for closing off the steam supply during oven clean- ing. The valve should be locked closed whenever employees are in the oven.

F.2.3 The main valve should be designed to open slowly, be- cause the release should first open a small bypass to allow time for employees in the vicinity to escape and also to protect the piping from severe water hammer. A steam trap should be connected to the steam supply near the main valve to keep this line free of condensate.

F.3 Steam Outlets. If steam is used, steam outlets should be sufficiently large to supply 8 lb/min (3.6 kg/min) of steam for each 100 ft³ (2.8 m³) of oven volume. The outlets preferably should be located near the bottom of the oven, but if the oven is not over 20 ft (6.1 m) high, they might be located near the top, pointing downward. Steam jets should be directed at dip tanks (in a manner to avoid disturbing the liquid surface) or other areas of special hazard.

Annex G Example of Class C Furnace Operational and Maintenance Checklist

2015 Edition NFPA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 127

86-124 OVENS AND FURNACES

(18) Inspect radiant tubes and heat exchanger tubes for leak- age; if necessary, repair them.
(19) Lubricate the instrumentation, valve motors, valves, blowers, compressors, pumps, and other components.
(20) Test instrumentation in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations.
(21) Test flame safeguard units.

G.5 Maintenance of Gas Equipment.

G.5.1 General. These recommendations are prepared for maintenance of gas equipment. Special types of equipment need special attention. A preventive maintenance program that includes adherence to the manufacturers' recommenda- tions should be established and followed. This program should establish a minimum maintenance schedule that in- cludes inspection and action on the recommendations pro- vided in G.5.2 through G.5.5. An adequate supply of spare parts should be maintained.

G.5.2 Burners and Pilots. Burners and pilots should be kept clean and in proper operating condition. Burner refractory parts should be examined at frequent, regular intervals to en- sure good condition.

G.5.3 Flame Safeguard Equipment. Where automatic flame safeguards are used, a complete shutdown and restart should be made at frequent intervals to check the components for proper operation.

G.5.4 Other Safeguard Equipment. Accessory safeguard equipment — such as manual reset valves, automatic safety shutoff valves, pressure or vacuum switches, high temperature limit switches, draft control, manual shutoff valves, airflow switches, door switches, and gas valves — should be operated at frequent, regular intervals to ensure proper functioning. If inoperative, they should be repaired or replaced promptly.

Where fire checks are installed in air-gas mixture piping, the pressure loss across the fire checks should be measured at regular intervals. Where excessive pressure loss is found, screens should be removed and cleaned. Water-type backfire checks should be inspected at frequent intervals, and the liq- uid level should be maintained.

G.5.5 Safety Shutoff Valves. All safety shutoff valves should be checked for leakage and proper operation at frequent, regu- lar intervals. An example procedure for testing gas safety shut- off valves is outlined in A.7.4.9.

G.6 Maintenance of Electric Furnaces and Equipment.

G.6.1 General. A program of regular inspection and mainte- nance of electric furnaces is essential to the safe operation of that equipment. Manufacturer's recommendations should be followed rigorously, resulting in a long, trouble-free furnace life. Suitable spare parts should be stocked to ensure quick replacement as needed.

G.6.2 Heating Elements. The heating elements should be in- spected at regular intervals and any foreign contamination removed. Repair is essential if elements are dislodged or dis- torted, causing them to touch alloy hearths or furnace compo- nents so that grounding or shorting can occur. Element termi- nals should be checked periodically and tightened because loose connections cause arcing and oxidation that can result in burn-out of the terminal.

G.6.3 Insulation and Refractory Materials. Furnace linings need attention where protective atmospheres are used, to make certain that excessive carbon has not been deposited.

Grounding or shorting of the elements can occur unless rec- ommended burn-out procedures are followed. Cracked or broken refractory element supports should be replaced as necessary.

G.6.4 Thermocouples. A regular replacement program should be established for all control and safety thermo- couples. The effective life of thermocouples varies, depending on the environment and the temperature, and these factors should be considered in setting up a replacement schedule.

G.6.5 Auxiliary and Control Devices. Contactors should be checked and replaced periodically where pitting due to arcing could result in welding of the contacts and uncontrolled appli- cation of power to the furnace. All control components, in- cluding pyrometers and relays, should be checked periodically to ensure proper operation or control accuracy. Instructions provided by the manufacturer of each control component should be followed with care.

G.6.6 Voltage. The voltage supplied to electric furnaces should be maintained within reasonable limits to ensure against overloading of control devices and transformers. Und- ervoltage can result in operational failure of relays and sole- noid valves.

G.6.7 Water Cooling. If components are water cooled, it is important to check the flow and the temperature of the cool- ing water frequently.

G.6.8 Interlocks. Periodic checks of all safety interlocks are essential. High frequency generators should have functioning door interlocks to prevent operators from entering the enclo- sure while any power is on. These safety devices should be checked frequently.

Annex H Vacuum Furnace Maintenance Checklist

*This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document but is included for informational purposes only.*

H.1 General. A program of regular inspection and mainte- nance of the vacuum furnace is essential to the safe operation of the equipment and should be instituted and followed rigor- ously. Basic heating devices, such as heating elements or in- duction coils, should be designed for ease of maintenance. If special tools are needed, they should be supplied by the fur- nace manufacturer.

H.1.1 Vacuum System. Mechanical vacuum pumps should be checked and repaired as necessary. The following is a partial list:

(1) Check that drive belts are not worn.
(2) Verify that drive belt tension is proper.
(3) Check that no oil leaks are at the shaft seals.
(4) Check that the oil level is correct.
(5) Inspect the oil to ensure it is free of dirt and water accu- mulation.
(6) Check that sediment traps are drained.
(7) Check that mounting bolts are tight.
(8) Inspect the vacuum lines and vibration couplings to en- sure they are tight.

The high vacuum diffusion pump should be checked and repaired as necessary. The following is a partial list:

(1) Test that the waterflow for cooling is correct.

ΑΝΝΕΧ Η                                                                                                                     86-125

(2) Inspect the heating elements to ensure they are tight and
indicate proper electrical parameters.
(3) Check that the oil level is correct.
(4) Check that the oil is not contaminated.

Control vacuum valves should be checked and repaired.
The following is a partial list:

(1) Check the air supply filter to ensure it is drained and op-
erating.
(2) Check that air supply oiler is filled to the correct level and
operating.
(3) Ensure that pilot valves are not leaking excess air.
(4) Clean the moving O-ring seals or change them if excess
wear is indicated.

The numerous stationary and moving vacuum seals,
O-rings, and other rubber gaskets associated with the main
vacuum vessel should be inspected properly to ensure cleanli-
ness, freedom from cracks or gouges, and retention of elastic-
ity. The main front and rear doors or the bottom head, where
work regularly passes, should receive particular attention.

H.1.2 Hot Zone (Resistance Heaters) — Power Supply. The
power supply should be inspected and corrected as required.
The following is a partial list:

(1) Check that the primary and secondary wiring and cables
are tight and free from overheating.
(2) Check for proper ventilation and that air cooling or
proper waterflow per unit or transformer is present.
(3) Inspect control relays or contactors for contact pitting or
arcing, which could result in contact welding.
(4) Verify that power supply voltage is maintained within rea-
sonable limits to ensure against overloading.

Note: Undervoltage can result in operational failure of any
one of the numerous vacuum furnace systems.

H.1.3 Hot Zone (Resistance Heaters) — Thermocouples. A
regular replacement program should be established for all
control and safety thermocouples.

It should be noted that the effective life of thermocouples
varies, depending on the environment and process, the tem-
perature, and the vacuum, and these factors should be consid-
ered in setting up a replacement program.

H.1.4 Hot Zone (Resistance Heaters) — Instrumentation.
Temperature and vacuum instrumentation should be set up
on a regular calibration and test schedule.

Many components of the vacuum furnace are required to
be water cooled. Drain lines should be inspected for proper
flow and temperature of the cooling water. Pressure regula-
tors, strainers, and safety vents should be inspected for proper
setting and maintained free from dirt and contamination.

If an evaporative cooling tower is integral to the furnace
system, the tower should be cleaned, the motor and bearings
greased, and the water strainer cleaned on a regular basis.

H.1.5 Hot Zone (Resistance Heaters) — Interlocks and
Alarms. Periodic checks of all safety interlocks and alarms
should be performed. Particular attention should be given to
overtemperature safety devices, low air pressure, insufficient
cooling water, and vacuum, oil temperature, and low oil
alarms.

leaks.

(5) The following periodic maintenance checks and proce-
dures should be made. The frequency of these checks and
procedures depends on the equipment manufacturers'
recommendations:

(a) Inspect vacuum chamber O-ring and other gaskets
for proper sealing.
(b) Review the vacuum chamber vessel for evidence of
hot spots that indicate improper water cooling.
(c) Review furnace internals in detail for heating ele-
ment, heat shield, and work support or mechanism
failure or deterioration.

> [Figure] 
> This figure is a chart showing pump ranges. The chart has two horizontal axes. The top axis represents Millimeters absolute (uniform scale), ranging from 760 to 40. The bottom axis represents Microns absolute (approximate logarithmic scale) ranging from 1000 to 10-4. There are several horizontal bars, each representing the range of a specific pump type. The pump types listed vertically from top to bottom are: Liquid piston rotary, Centrifugal, Two-impeller straight-lobe rotary, Helical-lobe rotary, Reciprocator, Multiple sliding-vane rotary, Ejector, Rotary piston, Vane, Diffusion pump.  The left side of the chart indicates "Single stage", "Multistage", and "Two stage" configurations. The right side of the chart indicates "Discharge pressure is usually atmospheric except on diffusion pumps" and "and higher".  There are also labels for "Scale changes" and a note stating "Varies considerably with size, make, and gas characteristics."

Annex K Vacuum Symbols

*This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document but is included for informational purposes only.*

K.1 General. This annex is reprinted from the AVS *Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology*, “Graphic Symbols in Vacuum Technology.”

*Introduction.*

Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to establish a uni- form system of graphic symbols in vacuum technology.

Definition and Application. The graphic symbols are a shorthand used to show graphically the functioning and inter- connections of vacuum components in a single-line schematic or flow diagram.

A single-line diagram is one in which the graphic symbols are shown without regard to the actual physical location, size, or shape of the components.

A symbol shall be considered as the aggregate of all its parts.

The orientation of a symbol on a drawing, including a mirror image presentation, does not alter the meaning of the symbol.

A symbol might be drawn to any scale that suits a particular drawing.

Arrows should be omitted unless necessary for clarification.

Explanation. The graphic symbols are divided into two separate sections, general and specific symbols.

Wherever possible, the general symbol illustrates the func- tion or appearance of a component without regard to special features.

The special symbols elaborate upon the general component categories with individual symbols that illustrate in detail the spe- cial features of the component. Wherever possible, the special symbol utilizes the general symbol outline. (See Figure K.1.)

Formal Interpretation

# NFPA 86

## Standard for Ovens and Furnaces

2015 Edition

Reference: 3.3.69.7
F.I. No.: 86-07-1

Question 1: Is a listed safety shutoff valve with proof-of-closure switch compliant with NFPA 86 when
the proof-of-closure switch is enclosed under a cover plate affixed with standard head screws?

Answer: Yes.

Question 2: Is a listed safety shutoff valve with proof-of-closure switch compliant with NFPA 86 when
its proof-of-closure switch is capable of being replaced in the field?

Answer: Yes.

Committee Statement: Some safety shutoff valves required by NFPA 86 are to include proof-of-closure
switches. The definition of “Proof-of-Closure Switch" includes “non-field adjustable" as one character-
istic of the switch. Some listed safety shutoff valves have proof-of-closure switches that can be accessed
by removing a cover plate affixed with standard head screws. Some "listed" safety shutoff valves have
proof-of-closure switches that can be replaced and adjusted as part of field servicing activities. In each
case, the proof-of-closure switch is not accessible to an operator for field adjustment, but the proof-of-
closure switch can be accessed by deliberate disassembly of the valve for service activity. In accordance
with the standard, all safety devices require periodic testing and maintenance in accordance with pub-
lished manufacturer's instructions.

Sequence of Events for the Standards
Development Process

As soon as the current edition is published, a Standard is open
for Public Input

Step 1: Input Stage

*   Input accepted from the public or other committees
    for consideration to develop the First Draft
*   Committee holds First Draft Meeting to revise Stan-
    dard (23 weeks)
*   Committee (s) with Correlating Committee (10 weeks)

*   Correlating Committee ballots on First Draft (5 weeks)
*   First Draft Report posted

Step 2: Comment Stage

*   Public Comments accepted on First Draft (10 weeks)
*   If Standard does not receive Public Comments and the
    Committee does not wish to further revise the Stan-
    dard, the Standard becomes a Consent Standard and
    is sent directly to the Standards Council for issuance

    cepted (5 weeks)
*   NITMAMs are reviewed and valid motions are certified
    for presentation at the Association Technical Meeting
*   Consent Standard bypasses Association Technical
    Meeting and proceeds directly to the Standards Coun-
    cil for issuance
*   NFPA membership meets each June at the Association
    Technical Meeting and acts on Standards with "Certi-
    fied Amending Motions" (certified NITMAMS)

NOTE 1: "Standard" connotes code, standard, recom-
mended practice, or guide.

NOTE 2: A representative includes an employee.

NOTE 3: While these classifications will be used by the
Standards Council to achieve a balance for Technical
Committees, the Standards Council may determine that
new classifications of member or unique interests need
representation in order to foster the best possible Com-
mittee deliberations on any project. In this connection,
the Standards Council may make such appointments
as it deems appropriate in the public interest, such as
the classification of "Utilities" in the National Electrical
Code Committee.

NOTE 4: Representatives of subsidiaries of any group
are generally considered to have the same classification
as the parent organization.

Information on the NFPA Standards Development Process

I. Applicable Regulations. The primary rules governing the processing of NFPA standards (codes, standards, recommended practices, and
guides) are the NFPA Regulations Governing the Development of NFPA Standards (Regs). Other applicable rules include NFPA Bylaws,
NFPA Technical Meeting Convention Rules, NFPA Guide for the Conduct of Participants in the NFPA Standards Development Process,
and the NFPA Regulations Governing Petitions to the Board of Directors from Decisions of the Standards Council. Most of these rules and
regulations are contained in the NFPA Standards Directory. For copies of the Directory, contact Codes and Standards Administration at
NFPA Headquarters; all these documents are also available on the NFPA website at "www.nfpa.org."

The following is general information on the NFPA process. All participants, however, should refer to the actual rules and regulations for a
full understanding of this process and for the criteria that govern participation.

II. Technical Committee Report. The Technical Committee Report is defined as "the Report of the responsible Committee(s), in
accordance with the Regulations, in preparation of a new or revised NFPA Standard." The Technical Committee Report is in two parts and
consists of the First Draft Report and the Second Draft Report. (See Regs at 1.4)

III. Step 1: First Draft Report. The First Draft Report is defined as "Part one of the Technical Committee Report, which documents the
Input Stage." The First Draft Report consists of the First Draft, Public Input, Committee Input, Committee and Correlating Committee
Statements, Correlating Input, Correlating Notes, and Ballot Statements. (See Regs at 4.2.5.2 and Section 4.3) Any objection to an action
in the First Draft Report must be raised through the filing of an appropriate Comment for consideration in the Second Draft Report or the
objection will be considered resolved. [See Regs at 4.3.1(b)]

IV. Step 2: Second Draft Report. The Second Draft Report is defined as "Part two of the Technical Committee Report, which documents
the Comment Stage." The Second Draft Report consists of the Second Draft, Public Comments with corresponding Committee Actions
and Committee Statements, Correlating Notes and their respective Committee Statements, Committee Comments, Correlating Revisions,
and Ballot Statements. (See Regs at Section 4.2.5.2 and 4.4) The First Draft Report and the Second Draft Report together constitute the
Technical Committee Report. Any outstanding objection following the Second Draft Report must be raised through an appropriate
Amending Motion at the Association Technical Meeting or the objection will be considered resolved. [See Regs at 4.4.1(b)]

V. Step 3a: Action at Association Technical Meeting. Following the publication of the Second Draft Report, there is a period during
which those wishing to make proper Amending Motions on the Technical Committee Reports must signal their intention by submitting a
Notice of Intent to Make a Motion. (See Regs at 4.5.2) Standards that receive notice of proper Amending Motions (Certified Amending
Motions) will be presented for action at the annual June Association Technical Meeting. At the meeting, the NFPA membership can
consider and act on these Certified Amending Motions as well as Follow-up Amending Motions, that is, motions that become necessary as
a result of a previous successful Amending Motion. (See 4.5.3.2 through 4.5.3.6 and Tablel, Columns 1-3 of Regs for a summary of the
available Amending Motions and who may make them.) Any outstanding objection following action at an Association Technical Meeting
(and any further Technical Committee consideration following successful Amending Motions, see Regs at 4.5.3.7 through 4.6.5.3) must be
raised through an appeal to the Standards Council or it will be considered to be resolved.

VI. Step 3b: Documents Forwarded Directly to the Council. Where no Notice of Intent to Make a Motion (NITMAM) is received and
certified in accordance with the Technical Meeting Convention Rules, the standard is forwarded directly to the Standards Council for action
on issuance. Objections are deemed to be resolved for these documents. (See Regs at 4.5.2.5)

VII. Step 4a: Council Appeals. Anyone can appeal to the Standards Council concerning procedural or substantive matters related to the
development, content, or issuance of any document of the Association or on matters within the purview of the authority of the Council, as
established by the Bylaws and as determined by the Board of Directors. Such appeals must be in written form and filed with the Secretary
of the Standards Council (See Regs at 1.6). Time constraints for filing an appeal must be in accordance with 1.6.2 of the Regs. Objections
are deemed to be resolved if not pursued at this level.

VIII. Step 4b: Document Issuance. The Standards Council is the issuer of all documents (see Article 8 of Bylaws). The Council acts on
the issuance of a document presented for action at an Association Technical Meeting within 75 days from the date of the recommendation
from the Association Technical Meeting, unless this period is extended by the Council (See Regs at 4.7.2). For documents forwarded
directly to the Standards Council, the Council acts on the issuance of the document at its next scheduled meeting, or at such other meeting
as the Council may determine (See Regs at 4.5.2.5 and 4.7.4).

IX. Petitions to the Board of Directors. The Standards Council has been delegated the responsibility for the administration of the codes
and standards development process and the issuance of documents. However, where extraordinary circumstances requiring the intervention
of the Board of Directors exist, the Board of Directors may take any action necessary to fulfill its obligations to preserve the integrity of the
codes and standards development process and to protect the interests of the Association. The rules for petitioning the Board of Directors
can be found in the Regulations Governing Petitions to the Board of Directors from Decisions of the Standards Council and in 1.7 of the
Regs.

X. For More Information. The program for the Association Technical Meeting (as well as the NFPA website as information becomes
available) should be consulted for the date on which each report scheduled for consideration at the meeting will be presented. For copies of
the First Draft Report and Second Draft Report as well as more information on NFPA rules and for up-to-date information on schedules
and deadlines for processing NFPA documents, check the NFPA website (www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes) or contact NFPA Codes &
Standards Administration at (617) 984-7246.
