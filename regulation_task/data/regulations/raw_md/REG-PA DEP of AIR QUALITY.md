The Air Management Services (AMS) component of the Philadelphia Department of
Public Health is the local air pollution control agency for the City and County of Philadelphia.
AMS programs are conducted under authority provided by the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter,
Philadelphia Code, the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act, and the federal Clean Air Act.
AMS is responsible for the prevention, abatement and control of air pollution and air pollution
nuisances, as required to achieve and maintain federal national ambient air quality standards
(NAAQS) within Philadelphia. AMS is also responsible for the control of airborne asbestos from
building renovation and demolition projects, and for the abatement of community noise and
vibration nuisances.

II. Public Services

AMS services to the public include review and evaluation of plans for proposed new and
modified sources of air contaminant emissions; issuance of facility operating permits for
approved sources; conducting facility compliance inspections, including source testing and the
taking of samples; responding to community complaints of air pollution and odors; citing
violations where observed; and initiating timely and appropriate enforcement actions to resolve
violations. AMS also operates a citywide air monitoring network that continuously samples
Philadelphia's air quality for compliance with federal standards, and provides daily information

with the state's asbestos worker certification requirements.

III. Program Organization

Organizationally, AMS is comprised of two central support groups, Administrative
Services and Program Services, and two operating groups, Regulatory Services and
Technical Services, each reporting to the AMS Program Director. The composition and
function of each organizational group is described below.

IV. Program Support Services

A. Administrative Services

The Administrative Services group is responsible for providing centralized
administrative and organizational support related to the development, allocation and
management of agency funding, personnel, and other program resources. Administrative
Services provides oversight and coordination of certain decentralized administrative support
functions associated with agency operating units. Areas of responsibility include
implementation of administrative policies and procedures; budget and revenues management;
contracts and grants management; facilities and fleet management; personnel management;
organizational development and workforce planning; training coordination; and program
activity and service level tracking and reporting. Administrative Services also provides
administrative and executive support to the operation of the city's Air Pollution Control
Board.

B. Program Services

The Program Services group is responsible for providing centralized support related
to the development and implementation of the AMS program, to ensure that its functions
and operations are maintained consistent with, and responsive to, needs and demands
imposed by federal and state requirements, regional initiatives, and local government and
community concerns. A significant part of Program Services' support role involves the
establishment of appropriate operations management and information systems necessary
to the effective functioning of the AMS program. Areas of responsibility include agency
strategic planning; inter- and intra-agency program coordination and integration;

also responsible for maintaining and upgrading the hardware and software components of
the AMS local area network (LAN) computer system; identifying and prioritizing agency
information system needs and related database program development; and for assuring
adequate end-user training and support in the use of hardware and software. Program Services
serves as a technical and informational resource to the city's Air Pollution Control Board.

V. Program Operations

A. Regulatory Services

The AMS Regulatory Services group is responsible for implementation and
enforcement of all applicable local, state and federal regulatory requirements pertaining to the
prevention and control of air pollution, asbestos contamination, and noise and vibration
nuisances within the City of Philadelphia. The Regulatory Services group is comprised of
three sections: Source Registration (Permitting), Facility Compliance and Enforcement, and
Asbestos Control.

1.  Source Registration

Source Registration is responsible for the review and approval/disapproval of
applications for installation, modification and operation of sources of air contaminant
emissions within the City of Philadelphia. Source Registration activities include review of
applications pertaining to: installation permits and operating licenses, as required under the
Philadelphia Code; plan approvals and operating permits, as required under *25 Pa. Code*
Chapter 127; and Title V, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD), New Source Review
(NSR), New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) permits, as required under the federal Clean Air Act.
State and federal permit requirements are administered and enforced locally pursuant to state and
federal delegations of authority made to the City of Philadelphia. Source Registration is also
responsible for issuance of source or facility permit and license approval documents, as
well as for conducting appropriate public notification and public involvement activities as may
pertain to applications under review, including the holding of public and administrative
hearings, and the preparation of responses to comments received from the public. To minimize
redundancy and paperwork burdens, Source Registration attempts, wherever possible, to
consolidate local permit requirements with any state/federal permit requirements that may
apply to a source or facility within Philadelphia. Source Registration is also responsible for
activities related to the stack testing of emission units and Continuous Emission Monitoring
Systems (CEMS). Stack testing activities include reviewing and approving test protocols,
observing stack tests, and reviewing stack test reports. CEMS activities include reviewing
and approving Phase I applications for the installation of new CEMS, observing parts of the
Phase II performance testing for new CEMS, and reviewing Phase III CEMS performance
test reports. Stack tests and CEMS must comply with *25 Pa. Code* Chapter 139, the
Pennsylvania Source Test Manual, and the Pennsylvania Continuous Monitoring Manual as
well as any applicable EPA reference methods and performance specifications.

Facility Compliance and Enforcement is responsible for implementation of local, state
and federal regulatory requirements applicable to sources and facilities within Philadelphia;
conducting compliance assurance inspections at permitted facilities; maintaining
citywide surveillance and responding to citizen complaints regarding air pollution, noise and
vibration nuisances; and for pursuing appropriate enforcement actions to resolve violations,
including entering into compliance agreements, filing for court-ordered consent decrees, and
seeking injunctive actions in cases posing imminent endangerment to public health.

The Compliance Assurance unit, through its engineering staff, is responsible for
monitoring source and facility compliance with regulatory and operating permit
requirements; preparing documentation for issuance of formal notices of violation (NOV) for
verified non-compliance; identifying "significant violators" for resolution in accordance with
U.S. EPA's Compliance Monitoring Strategy (CMS) and guidance; performing data collection
and validation activities for maintenance of the air emissions inventory for Philadelphia; and
providing appropriate information for uploading to the U.S. EPA's Air Information
Retrieval (AIRS) facility compliance data system. Compliance evaluation techniques
utilized include conducting facility inspections, reviewing and auditing facility compliance
certifications, testing of emissions and process materials, and engineering estimates and
material balances. Compliance Assurance field inspectors, working in cooperation with the
engineering staff, assist in performing compliance inspections for minor sources, in addition to
their duties related to providing citywide emissions surveillance and complaint response. A
field inspector is available on a 24-hour basis, on workdays, weekends and holidays, either
on active duty, standby, or emergency response mode. In addition to investigating
complaints related to air pollution, noise and vibration, field inspectors also respond to
incidents involving possible leaking combustible gases and carbon monoxide from
residential heating units, as well as providing appropriate assistance to first responders and
incident commanders in events involving toxic or hazardous materials releases or spills.

The Enforcement unit is responsible for coordinating all enforcement activities of the
AMS program. Cases that are determined appropriate for enforcement action are referred
from the compliance evaluation and inspectional units for further action. Activities of the unit
include: NOV preparation and issuance; case development and coordination with the city's
Law Department; assessment of administrative penalties; negotiation of compliance
agreements; enforcement coordination with the U.S. EPA, the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP), and the city's Environmental Task Force; prosecution of
summary violations; and the development of enforcement protocols and procedures.

3. Asbestos Control

The Asbestos Control unit is responsible for implementation and enforcement of local,
state and federal requirements applicable to the control of emissions of asbestos and the
regulation of the asbestos abatement industry. The unit, pursuant to local delegation of authority
from the U.S. EPA, enforces the federal NESHAP for Asbestos at renovation and demolition

sites; and also provides, via interagency agreement, local compliance oversight for the PA
Department of Labor & Industry's certification requirements for asbestos workers and
supervisors. The Asbestos Control unit also administers and enforces the provisions of the
Philadelphia Health Code pertaining to asbestos abatement project workplace standards;
licensing of asbestos abatement contractors; certification of asbestos analytical laboratories,
project inspectors, and investigators; and review and issuance of permits for major asbestos
projects. The unit also develops and provides public distribution of information pertaining to
asbestos control program activities and requirements, as well as asbestos-related health and
safety advisory information for residents, school students, and building maintenance workers.

B. Technical Services

The AMS Technical Services group, based at the AMS Laboratory, is responsible
for operation of the citywide air quality monitoring network; acquisition, quality assurance,
and reporting of air quality data; and providing analytical laboratory and analytical methods
development support to air quality monitoring activities, special air sampling studies, and to
Regulatory Services' compliance assurance sampling and analysis programs. The Technical
Services group is comprised of three sections: Air Monitoring, Computer Center, and Analytical
Chemistry.

1. Air Monitoring

The Air Monitoring section is responsible for operation and maintenance of the 11
air sampling sites (a twelfth site is being planned and will be added) comprising the citywide
air monitoring network including one Ncore-National Core multipollutant monitoring station
measuring particles, Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Oxides, Lead and
basic meteorology principally support research in air pollution control. The network is
designed and equipped with instrumentation to provide measurements of ambient
concentrations for seven federally-designated "criteria" air pollutants - air pollutants for
which the U.S. EPA has established NAAQS - consisting of Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide,
Nitrogen Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Lead, PM10 (respirable particulate matter less than 10
microns), and PM2.5 (fine particulate matter/aerosols less than 2.5 microns). The
monitoring instruments employed conform with federal reference methods established
nationally, and ambient measurements collected are used to determine the city's air quality
status with regard to each of the federal NAAQS pollutants. Data from continuous air
sampling instruments operated at 5 of the sites are digitally transmitted over telephone lines
to the AMS Laboratory, providing real-time access to air quality measurements for the four
gaseous pollutants and a surrogate pollutant for particulate matter. The real-time data are
employed to provide daily air quality reports to the public using the federal Air Quality
Index or AQI. An intensive Photochemical Assessment Monitoring System, or PAMS
project, has been instituted as part of a national initiative to measure ozone and ozone
precursors during the "ozone season." In Philadelphia, the PAMS project is conducted
during the months of June, July, and August at one site, and includes speciation of over 56
distinct organic compounds through analysis by gas chromatography. Air Monitoring is also
involved in providing support to special monitoring projects initiated both within AMS, for
local air quality impact assessments, and externally by the U.S. EPA and other

5

organizations, for purposes of monitoring methods development or data gathering for health
effects studies or environmental characterizations. AMS also participates in the EPA
performance Evaluation Audit (Audit through-the-probe, or TTP) program run by EPA
Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS). OAQPS runs the PM2.5
performance evaluation program for AMS. Air Monitoring also maintains and calibrates
portable sampling equipment used by inspectional staff within AMS' Regulatory Services
and also that used by the Philadelphia Fire Department in responding emergency situations.

2. Computer Center

The Computer Center is responsible for providing data processing services for Technical
Services' air monitoring and laboratory operations. These services include management of
ESC E-Data Acquisition System, SQL-Server, Oracle Server, File server, and twenty four
workstations with PCs... Computer Center personnel are responsible for hardware systems
design and construction, program development and implementation, systems maintenance,
database management and reporting, and user support through information distribution and
training. The majority of the activities of the Computer Center are devoted to supporting the air
quality monitoring and data reporting systems required by federal regulations. A gas
chromatograph, three liquid chromatographs, and an atomic absorption spectrophotometer are
being interfaced with one of the scientific computer systems in order to increase productivity
and to ease data analysis and reporting workloads. The Computer Center also provides
personal computer (PC) workstations for AMS Laboratory staff for use in word-processing,
spreadsheet, and data base applications. These PC systems are used for report writing,
fiscal work, and general administrative functions performed at the AMS Laboratory.

3. Analytical Chemistry

The Analytical Chemistry section is responsible for providing a wide range of laboratory
services, involving support to air monitoring activities and performance of non-routine chemical
analysis projects.

The Calibration unit is responsible for performing required precision and accuracy
checks on the air monitoring instruments deployed throughout the citywide network,
including maintenance and flow checks on system auto-calibration equipment and performance of
annual instrument audits using U.S. EPA-designated audit equipment. The Calibration unit
also performs quarterly audits on particulate monitors. Responsibilities extend to general
troubleshooting and maintenance of air monitoring equipment.

The General Chemistry unit is responsible for weighing and analysis of filter samples
obtained from the particulate monitoring instruments within the citywide network, and for
maintaining all required measurement records. In addition to performing gravimetric analysis of
filters from PM10 and PM2.5 samplers, filters from high volume air samplers (HVAS),
collecting total suspended particulates (TSP), are analyzed for lead plus seven other trace metals
(chromium, cadmium, iron, manganese, nickel, zinc, copper). The unit also performs qualitative
and quantitative analyses on soils, as well as on samples obtained from special purpose
monitors (SPM) deployed for study purposes. The General Chemistry unit maintains

capability for monitoring gross beta-radioactivity on TSP filters, performs measurements of
conductivity and pH on precipitation samples collected during significant rainfall events, and
conducts analyses of sulfur content in fuel oil samples taken to monitor compliance with the
city's sulfur-in-fuel regulations. The unit is also responsible for performing general
microscopy work related to identification and analysis of asbestos in bulk material samples
collected by inspectors in the Asbestos Control unit; identification of particulate samples taken
from areas impacted by soot falls, or other excessive particle deposition incidents, for
purposes of determining possible responsible sources; and for providing pollen counts during
the ragweed pollen season.

The Air Toxics unit is responsible for collection (via sorbent tubes/canisters), preparation,
and identification and analysis, by GC/MS, of air samples for a wide range of trace organic
pollutants. Air sampling for formaldehyde (plus six other compounds) is conducted using a
separate monitoring method and analysis is performed by high pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC). Air filters from 5 sites are sent to West Virginia for analysis of seven metals
(Arsenic, Beryllium, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Manganese, and Nickel). The Air Toxics
unit has also been involved in providing sample collection and analytical support to community
exposure assessments and other special studies related to measuring ambient concentrations
of certain toxic organic compounds in the vicinity of industrial or commercial sources.

Facilities that wish to generate or trade Emission Reduction Credits (ERC) will need to
document emissions. The annual inventory report is one way to document emissions. All
facilities have the option of submitting annual inventory reports for ERC purposes. If the facility
does not submit annual inventory data, the facility should at least maintain sufficient production
records to be able to reconstruct emissions for ERC purposes.

The emissions from any facility that is not required to submit annual inventory forms are
captured in the area source inventory, which is calculated using demographics and emission
factors. For information on area source inventory, contact the Bureau of Air Quality's Air
Information Management Section at (717) 783-9241.

Any emissions that are below the source reporting thresholds for facilities that are
subject to the annual inventory will be calculated by the Bureau of Air Quality using emission
factors. Facilities have the option of submitting emission estimates for emissions below the
source thresholds if the owner/operator of the company's estimate is better than the factor-
generated numbers.

A. Title V Facilities

The owners/operators of all Title V facilities must complete the annual inventory
reporting forms. Title V facilities are subject because by definition they exceed the reporting
thresholds in the Emission Statement and SIP regulations. Inventory information from Title V
facilities is used for emission fee purposes and to demonstrate compliance.

Title V facilities report emissions from all sources, as the sources are defined in the Title
V permit. In some cases, the Title V permit treats multiple pieces of related equipment as one
source. This treatment is negotiated between the facility and DEP inventory and permit staff.
Actual emissions of 1.0 tons per year or more per source must be reported for all criteria
pollutants and 0.5 tons per year of HAPs, except for the HAPs of special concern listed below.
Reports should round to the nearest one-hundredth of a ton. All emissions must be reported
source by source, not as site totals. HAPs must be reported individually (speciated). Source by
source speciated reporting of HAPs is required for Maximum Achievable Control Technology

17

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 40

(MACT) purposes. In cases where HAPs are also VOCs or particulates, do not subtract the HAP
emission estimates from the VOC or particulate emission estimates. The subtraction will be
dealt with by the AIMS database.

Based upon the Federal Clean Air Act, Section 112(c)(6), certain pollutants and sources
are of special concern. The following thresholds apply for boilers greater than 2.5 MMBtu,
incinerators, lead handling operations, and utilities:

|                       |               |
| :-------------------- | :------------ |
| Polychlorobiphenols (PCB) | 0.01 TPY per source |
| Lead (Pb)             | 0.01 TPY per source |
| Polycyclic Organic Matter (POM) | 0.01 TPY per source |
| Dioxins               | 0.00001 TPY per source |
| Furans                | 0.00001 TPY per source |
| Mercury (Hg) non-coal fired electric generating units (EGU) | 0.0005 TPY per source |
| Mercury (Hg) coal fired EGUS | 0.0001 TPY per source |
| Mercury (Hg) all other types of sources | 0.01 TPY per source |


B. Synthetic Minor Facilities

NOx and VOC data may be required for Emission Statements and ozone calculations.
Synthetic minor facilities may be required to complete annual inventory reporting forms when
NOx and/or VOC emissions are generated. Facilities are subject if actual VOC emissions are
greater than or equal to 10 TPY for the site and /or if actual NOx emissions are greater than or
equal to 25 TPY for the site. Actual emissions of 1.0 TPY or more per source must be
reported for NOx and/or VOC, whichever made the facility subject to reporting. Reports
should round to the nearest one-hundredth of a ton. All emissions must be reported source by
source, not as site totals.

For example, if a facility has 12 TPY of actual VOC emissions and 20 TPY of actual NOx
emissions, the facility must report VOCs from any source that emitted 1 TPY or more. Any
sources that emit NOx are not required to be reported, as the facility's NO, emissions are below
the threshold. If the facility has 12 TPY of actual VOC emissions and 26 TPY of actual NOx
emissions, the facility must report VOCs and NOx.

Emission estimates for other pollutants will be calculated by DEP's AIMS database
using emission factors associated with source classification codes (SCC). The facility
owner/operator has the option of reporting emission estimates for other pollutants if the
facility's estimates are better than the SCC-based calculations.

Synthetic minor facilities must certify and/or demonstrate that the permit caps have not
been exceeded. The certification/demonstration does not require source by source reporting of
operating data and emission estimates using the annual inventory forms. The facility has
the option of completing the annual inventory forms to demonstrate compliance with the
caps for any pollutants. If the facility does not submit annual inventory forms, the facility
owner/operator must arrange with Philadelphia County or DEP regional staff for an alternate

18

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 41

demonstration of synthetic minor status. The regional staff will use the demonstration data to
calculate site total emission estimates and enter these estimates into AIMS. If an existing
permit caps a specific source, emissions from the capped source would have to be reported
separately from any site totals. Electronic submission of alternate demonstration data may
not be possible.

C. Natural Minor with a State Operating Permit

NOx and VOC data may be required for Emission Statements and ozone calculations.
The owners/operators of natural minor facilities with operating permits may be required to
complete annual inventory reporting forms when NOx and/or VOC emissions are generated.
Facilities are subject if actual VOC emissions are greater than or equal to 10 TPY for the
site. Facilities are also subject if actual NOx emissions are greater than or equal to 25 TÎ¡Î¥
for the site. The facility owner/operator must report only NOx and/or VOCs, whichever made
the facility subject to reporting. Actual emissions of 1.0 ton per year or more per source must
be reported for all criteria pollutants and 0.5 tons per year of HAPs. Reports should round to
the nearest one-hundredth of a ton. All emissions must be reported source by source, not as
site totals. See the example for Synthetic Minors. Emission estimates for other pollutants
will be calculated by the AIMS database using SCCs. The facility has the option of reporting
emission estimates for other pollutants if the facility's estimates are better than the
SCC-based calculations.

If the facility only generates SOx, PM, CO and/or HAPs, or if the facility generates NOx
and VOC and both are below the thresholds, the facility is not subject to the inventory.

D. Natural Minors Exempted from State Operating Permit

These facilities are not required to submit annual inventory forms. The emissions from
these facilities are captured in the area source inventory.

section have been met and there has been performed upon such
source a test operation or evaluation which shall satisfy the
department that the air contamination source will not discharge
into the outdoor atmosphere any air contaminants at a rate in
excess of that permitted by applicable regulation of the board,
or in violation of any performance or emission standard or other
requirement established by the Environmental Protection Agency
or the department for such source, and which will not cause air
pollution. ion.

(3) A stationary air contamination source operating lawfully
without a permit for which fees required by section 6.3 of this
act or the regulations promulgated under this act have been
paid is authorized to continue to operate without a permit until
one hundred twenty (120) days after the department provides
notice to the source that a permit is required or until November
1, 1996, whichever occurs first. If the applicant submits a
complete permit application within the time frames in this
subsection and the department fails to issue a permit through
no fault of the applicant, the source may continue to operate
if the fees required by section 6.3 or the regulations
promulgated under this act have been paid and the source is
operated in conformance with this act, the Clean Air Act and
the regulations promulgated under both this act and the Clean
Air Act. For any performance or emission standard or other
requirement established by the Environmental Protection Agency
or the department for the source subsequent to the effective
date of this act but prior to the permit issuance date, the
permit may contain a compliance schedule authorizing the source
to operate out of compliance and requiring the source to achieve
compliance as soon as possible but no later than the time
required by this act, the Clean Air Act or the regulations
promulgated under either this act or the Clean Air Act. For
purposes of this subsection, a source is operating lawfully
without a permit where it is a source for which no permit was
previously requi required and the source is operating in compliance
with applicable regulatory requirements.

(4) For repermitting of any stationary air contamination
source which is operating under a valid permit on the effective
date of this act or which has received a permit under the
provisions of clauses (2) and (3) of this subsection and which
is required to meet performance or emission standards or other
requirements established subsequent to the issuance of the
existing permit, the new permit may contain a compliance
schedule authorizing the source to operate out of compliance
and requiring the source to achieve compliance as soon as
possible but no later than the time required by this act, the
Clean Air Act or the regulations promulgated under either this
act or the Clean Air Act.

(b.1) A permit or plan approval issued hereunder may contain
such terms and conditions as the department deems necessary to
assure the proper operation of the source. The board shall by
regulation establish a permit shield for permits issued under
the authority delegated to the Commonwealth by the EPA under
Title V of the Clean Air Act. The program shall be consistent
with the requirements of section 504(f) of the Clean Air Act
and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Each permittee, on
a schedule established by the department, shall submit reports
to the department containing such information as the department
may prescribe relative to the operation and maintenance of the
source.

(b.2) A permit issued or reissued under subsection (b) of this section shall be issued for a five (5) year term unless a shorter term is required to comply with the Clean Air Act and regulations promulgated thereunder or the permittee requests a shorter term, except that a permit for acid deposition control shall be issued for a five (5) year term. A permit may be terminated, modified, suspended or revoked and reissued for cause. The terms and conditions of an expired permit are automatically continued pending the issuance of a new permit where the permittee has submitted a timely and complete application for a new permit and paid the fees required by section 6.3 or the regulations promulgated under this act and the department is unable, through no fault of the permittee, to issue or deny a new permit before the expiration date of the previous permit. Failure of the department to issue or deny a new permit prior to the expiration date of the previous permit shall be an appealable action as described in section 10.2. The hearing board may require that the department take action on an application without additional delay.

(b.3) The board shall by regulation establish adequate, streamlined and reasonable procedures for expeditiously determining when applicatio applications are complete and for expeditious review of applications. The department shall approve or disapprove a complete application, consistent with the procedures established by the board for consideration of such applications, within eighteen (18) months after the date of receipt of the complete application except that the department shall establish a phased schedule for acting on permit applications submitted within the first full year after the effective date of the Title V permit program established to implement the requirements of the Clean Air Act. The schedule shall assure that at least one-third of such permits shall be acted upon by the department annually over a period not to exceed three (3) years after such effective date. Failure of the department to issue or deny a permit by a deadline established by this subsection shall be an appealable action as described in section 10.2 of this act. The hearing board may require that the department take action on an application without additional delay.

(b.4) (1) During the term of a permit, a permittee may reactivate any source under the permit that has been out of operation or production for a period of one year or more, provided that the permittee has submitted a reactivation plan to and received written approval from the department. The reactivation plan shall describe the measures that will be taken to ensure the source will be reactivated in compliance with all applicable permit requirements. A reactivation plan may be submitted to and approved by the department at any time during the term of a permit. The department shall take action on the reactivation plan within thirty (30) days unless the department determines that additional time is needed based on the size or complexity of the reactivated source.

(2) A reactivation plan may also be submitted to and approved by the department as part of the plan approval or permit application process. An owner or operator who has an approved reactivation plan shall notify the department prior to the reactivation of the source.

(b.5) The board shall adopt the regulations required by subsections (b.1), (b.3) and (i) as part of the regulatory package to implement the operating permit program required by Title V of the Clean Air Act.

(c) A plan approval or permit issued hereunder may be
terminated, modified, suspended or revoked and reissued if the
permittee constructs or operates the source subject to the plan
approval or permit in such a manner as to be in violation of
this act, the Clean Air Act, the regulations promulgated under
either this act or the Clean Air Act, a plan approval or permit
or in such a manner as to cause air pollution, if the permittee
fails to properly or adequately maintain or repair any air
pollution control device or equipment attached to or otherwise
made a part of the source, if the permittee has failed to submit
a report required by a plan approval or operating permit under
this section or if the Environmental Protection Agency
determines that the permit is not in compliance with the
requirements of the Clean Air Act or the regulations promulgated
under the Clean Air Act.
(d) The department may refuse to grant plan approval for
any stationary air contamination source subject to the
provisions of subsection (a) of this section or to issue a
permit to any source that the department determines is likely
to cause air pollution or to violate this act, the Clean Air
Act or the regulations promulgated under either this act or the
Clean Air Act applicable to such source or if, in the design
of such source, no provision is made for adequate verification
of compliance, including source testing or alternative means
to verify compliance. The department may also refuse to issue
a permit or may for cause terminate or revoke and reissue any
permit to any person if the Environmental Protection Agency
determines that the permit is not in compliance with the
requirements of the Clean Air Act or the regulations promulgated
under the Clean Air Act or if the applicant has constructed,
installed, modified or operated any air contamination source
or installed any air pollution control equipment or device on
such source contrary to the plans and specifications approved
by the department.
(e) Whenever the department shall refuse to grant an
approval or to issue or reissue a permit hereunder or terminate,
modify, suspend or revoke a plan approval or permit already
issued, such action shall be in the form of a written notice
to the person affected thereby informing him of the action taken
by the department and setting forth, in such notice, a full and
complete statement of the reasons for such action. Such notice
shall be served upon the person affected, either personally or
by certified mail, and the action set forth in the notice shall
be final and not subject to review unless, within thirty (30)
days of the service of such notice, any person affected thereby
shall appeal to the hearing board, setting forth with
particularity the grounds relied upon. The hearing board shall
hear the appeal pursuant to the provisions of the rules and
regulations relating to practice and procedure before the
hearing board, and thereafter, shall issue an adjudication
affirming, modifying or overruling the action of the department.
(f) The department may by regulation establish a general
plan approval and a general permit program. After the program
is established, the department may grant general plan approval
or a general permit for any category of stationary air
contamination source if the department determines that the
sources in such category are similar in nature and can be
adequately regulated using standardized specifications and
conditions. Any applicant proposing to use a general plan
approval or general permit shall notify the department and
receive written approval prior to the proposed use. The

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 60

department shall take action on a notification within thirty
(30) days.

(g) The department may by regulation establish a plan
approval and permit program for stationary sources operated at
multiple temporary locations. After the program is established,
the department may grant a plan approval or issue a single
permit to any stationary air contamination source that may be
operated at multiple temporary locations. Such approval or
permit shall require the owner or operator to notify the
department and municipality where the operation shall take place
in advance of each change in location and may require a separate
application and permit or approval fee for operations at each
location. Any applicant proposing to use the plan approval or
permit authorized by this subsection shall notify the department
and receive written approval prior to the proposed use. The
department shall take action on a request within thirty (30)
days.

(h) The department shall establish comprehensive plan
approval and operating permit programs which meet the
requirements of this act and the Clean Air Act.

(i) The board shall by regulation establish provisions to

requiring a permit revision, if the changes are not
modifications under any provision of 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85 Subch. I
(relating to programs and activities) and the changes do not
exceed the emissions allowable under the permit whether
expressed therein as a rate of emissions or in terms of total
emissions, provided that the facility provides the administrator
and the department with written notification at least seven (7)
days in advance of the proposed changes, unless the board
provides in its regulations a different time frame for
emergencies.

(j) The department shall make available to the public any
permit application, compliance plan, permit and monitoring or
compliance report required by this act.

(k) The department shall require revisions to any permit
to incorporate applicable standards and regulations promulgated
under the Clean Air Act after the issuance of such permit. Such
revisions shall occur as expeditiously as practicable, but not
later than eighteen (18) months after the promulgation of such
standards and regulations. No such revision shall be required
if the effective date of the standards or regulations is a date
after the expiration of the permit term or if less than three
(3) years remain on the permit. Such permit revision shall be
treated as a permit renewal if it complies with the requirements
of this act regarding renewals.
(6.1 amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)

Section 6.2. Emergency Procedure.--(a) Any other provision
of law to the contrary notwithstanding, if the department finds,
in accordance with the rules and regulations of the board
adopted under the provisions of clause (5) of section 5 of this
act, that a generalized condition of air pollution exists and
that it creates an emergency requiring immediate action to
protect human health or safety, the department, with the
concurrence of the Governor, shall order or direct persons
causing or contributing to the air pollution to immediately
reduce or discontinue the emission of air contaminants. ((a)
amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)

(b) In the absence of a generalized condition of air
pollution, if the department finds that emissions from the
operation of one or more air contamination sources are creating

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 61

an imminent danger to human health or safety, the department
may, without regard to the provisions of section 4 of this act,
order the persons responsible for the operation of the air
contamination sources in question to immediately reduce or
discontinue the emission of air contaminants.
(c) An order issued under subsection (a) or (b) of this
section shall fix a place and time, not later than twenty-four
hours thereafter, for a hearing to be held before the hearing
board. Within twenty-four hours after the commencement of such

(6.2 added Oct. 26, 1972, P.L.989, No.245)
Section 6.3. Fees.--(a) This section authorizes the
establishment of fees sufficient to cover the indirect and
direct costs of administering the air pollution control plan
approval process, operating permit program required by Title V
of the Clean Air Act, other requirements of the Clean Air Act
and the indirect and direct costs of administering the Small
Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental
Compliance Assistance Program, Compliance Advisory Committee
and Office of Small Business Ombudsman. This section also
authorizes the board by regulation to establish fees to support
the air pollution control program authorized by this act and
not covered by fees required by section 502(b) of the Clean Air
Act.
(b) An annual interim air emission fee of fourteen dollars
($14.00) per ton on emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides, particulate matter of ten (10) microns or less and
volatile organic compounds is hereby established to cover the
reasonable direct and indirect costs of developing and
administering the air pollution control operating permit program
required by Title V of the Clean Air Act, other requirements
of the Clean Air Act and the reasonable indirect and direct
costs of administering the Small Business Stationary Source
Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program,
Compliance Advisory Committee and the Office of Small Business
Ombudsman to be collected during fiscal year 1992-1993 covering
actual emissions occurring in calendar year 1991, fiscal year
1993-1994 covering actual emissions occurring in calendar year
1992 and fiscal year 1994-1995 covering actual emissions
occurring during calendar year 1993. The interim fee shall not
apply to air emissions of less than one hundred (100) tons for
any of the listed pollutants, provided that when emissions
exceed one hundred (100) tons the entire amount of all air
emissions for any of the listed pollutants up to five thousand
five hundred (5,500) tons shall be chargeable emissions for
interim fee purposes.
(c) The board shall establish by regulation a permanent
annual air emission fee as required for regulated pollutants
by section 502(b) of the Clean Air Act to cover the reasonable
direct and indirect costs of administering the operating permit
program required by Title V of the Clean Air Act, other related
requirements of the Clean Air Act and the reasonable indirect
and direct costs of administering the Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program, Compliance Advisory Committee and the Office of Small
Business Ombudsman to be collected starting in fiscal year
1995-1996 covering air emissions occurring during calendar year
1994. In no case shall the amount of the permanent fee be more

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 62

than that which is necessary to comply with section 502(b) of
the Clean Air Act. The permanent fee shall not apply to
emissions of more than four thousand (4,000) tons for any
regulated pollutant. In the event a final regulation containing
the permanent annual air emission fee is not effective by July
1, 1995, the permanent annual air emission fee for sources
subject to the Title V operating permit program shall be the
adjusted minimum dollar amount set under section 502(b) of the
Clean Air Act until such time as the final regulation is
effective.

(d) Unless precluded by the Clean Air Act, the board shall
establish a permanent air emission fee which considers the size
of the air contamination source, the resources necessary to
process the application for plan approval or an operating
permit, the complexity of the plan approval or operating permit,
the quantity and type of emissions from the sources, the amount
of fees charged in neighboring states, the importance of not
placing existing or prospective sources in this Commonwealth
at a competitive disadvantage and other relevant factors.

(e) Until alternative fees are established by the board
under subsection (c) of this section, stationary air
contamination sources shall pay the following interim fees:

(1) Two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the processing of an
application for an operating permit.

(2) Two hundred dollars ($200.00) for annual operating
permit administration fee.

(f) No emissions fee established under subsection (b), (c)
or (j) of this section shall be payable by any State entity,
instrumentality or political subdivision in relation to any
publicly owned or operated facility.

(g) Any fees imposed under this section in areas with
approved local air pollution control programs shall be deposited
in a restricted account established by the governing body
authorizing the local program for use by that program to
implement the provisions of this act for which they are
responsible. The governing body shall annually submit to the
department an audit of the account in order to insure the funds
were properly spent.

(h) (1) Unless the board establishes a different payment
schedule by regulation, each facility subject to the emission
fees established in subsections (b) and (c) of this section
shall report its emissions and pay the fee within one hundred
twenty (120) days after receipt of a reporting form from the
department or by September 1 of each year for the emission from
the preceding year, whichever occurs first.

(2) An air contamination source that fails to pay the fees
within the time frame established by this act or by regulation
shall pay a penalty of fifty per centum (50%) of the fee amount,
plus interest on the fee amount computed in accordance with
section 6621(a) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Public
Law 99-514, 26 U.S.C. Â§ 1 et seq.) from the date the fee was
required to be paid. In addition, such source may have its
permit terminated or suspended. The fee, penalty and interest
may be collected following the process for assessment and
collection of a civil penalty contained in section 9.1.

(i) The permanent air emission fee imposed under subsection
(c) shall be increased in each year after implementation of the
fee by regulation by the percentage, if any, by which the
Consumer Price Index for the most recent calendar year exceeds
the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year 1989. For
purposes of this subsection:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 63

(1) The Consumer Price Index for any calendar year is the
average of the Consumer Price Index for All-Urban Consumers,
published by the United States Department of Labor, as of the
close of the twelve (12) month period ending on August 31 of
each calendar year.
(2) The revision of the Consumer Price Index which is most
consistent with the Consumer Price Index for calendar year 1989
shall be used.
(j) The board may by regulation establish the following
categories of fees not related to Title V of the Clean Air Act.
Until such regulations are adopted, stationary air contamination
sources shall pay the following fees:
(1) Two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the processing of any
application for plan approval.
(2) Two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the processing of any
application for an operating permit.
(3) Two hundred dollars ($200.00) for annual operating
permit administration fee.
In regard to fees established under this subsection, individual
sources required to be regulated by Title V of the Clean Air
Act shall only be subject to plan approval fees authorized in
this subsection.
(k) No administrative action shall prevent the deposit of
the fees established pursuant to this section in the Clean Air
Fund established in section 9.2 during the fiscal year in which
they are collected. The fees shall only be used for the purposes
authorized in this section and section 9.2 and shall not be
transferred or diverted to any other purpose by administrative
action.
(1) Any fees, penalties and interest owed the Commonwealth
for delinquent payment collected under this section shall be
deposited in the Clean Air Fund.
(m) As used in this section, the term "regulated pollutant"
shall mean a volatile organic compound, each pollutant regulated
under sections 111 and 112 of the Clean Air Act and each
pollutant for which a national primary ambient air quality
standard has been promulgated, except that carbon monoxide shall
be excluded from this reference.
(6.3 added July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)
Section 6.4. Fee for Certain Ozone Areas.--(a) If an area
identified in a State implementation plan or any revision as a
severe or extreme ozone nonattainment area has failed to meet
the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone by
the applicable attainment date, each major source of volatile
organic compounds (VOC's), as defined in the Clean Air Act and
the regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act, located
in the area shall, except with respect to emissions during any
year treated as an extension year under section 181(a) (5) of
the Clean Air Act, pay a fee to the department as a penalty for
such failure for each calendar year beginning after the
attainment date until the area is redesignated as an attainment
area for ozone. This fee shall be assessed and collected
following the process for collection and assessment of a civil
penalty contained in section 9.1.
(b) (1) The fee shall equal five thousand dollars
($5,000.00), adjusted in accordance with clause (3) of this
subsection, per ton of VOC emitted by the source during the
calendar year in excess of eighty per centum (80%) of the
baseline amount, computed under clause (2) of this subsection.
The fee shall be in addition to all other fees required to be
paid by the source.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 64

(2) (i) For purposes of this section, the baseline amount shall be computed, in accordance with such guidance as the administrator may provide, as the lower of the amount of actual VOC emissions (referred to as actuals) or VOC emissions allowed under the permit applicable to the source or, if no such permit has been issued for the attainment year, the amount of VOC emissions allowed under the applicable implementation plan (referred to as allowables) during the attainment year.
(ii) Notwithstanding subclause (i) of this clause, the administrator may issue guidance authorizing the baseline amount to be determined in accordance with the lower of average actuals or average allowables determined over a period of more than one (1) calendar year. This guidance may provide that the average calculation for a specific source may be used if that source's emissions are irregular, cyclical or otherwise vary significantly from year to year.
(3) The fee amount under clause (1) of this subsection shall be adjusted annually, beginning 1991 in accordance with subsections (h) and (i) of section 6.3.
(c) For areas with a total population under two hundred thousand (200,000) which fail to attain the standard by the applicable attainment date, no sanction under this section or under any other provisions of this act shall apply if the area can demonstrate, consistent with guidance issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, that attainment in the area is prevented because of ozone or ozone precursors transported from other areas. The prohibition applies only in cases in which the area has met all requirements and implemented all measures applicable to the area under the Clean Air Act.
(6.4 added July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)
Section 6.5. Acid Deposition Control.--(a) The department is authorized to develop a permit program for acid deposition control in accordance with Titles IV and V of the Clean Air Act and to submit it to the administrator for approval.

(c) The owner or operator or the designated representative of each source affected under section 405 of the Clean Air Act shall submit a permit application and compliance plan for the affected source to the department no later than January 1, 1996. In the case of affected sources for which application and plans are timely received, the permit application and the compliance plan, including amendments thereto, shall be binding on the owner or operator or the designated representative of the owners or operators and shall be enforceable as a permit for purposes of this section until a permit is issued by the department. Any permit issued by the department shall require the source to achieve compliance as soon as possible but no later than the date required by this act, the Clean Air Act or the regulations promulgated under either this act or the Clean Air Act for the source.
(d) At any time after the submission of a permit application and compliance plan, the applicant may submit a revised application and compliance plan. In considering any permit application and compliance plan under this section, the department shall coordinate with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission consistent with requirements that may be established by the administrator.
(e) In addition to other provisions, permits issued by the department shall prohibit all of the following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 65

(1) Annual emissions of sulfur dioxide in excess of the
number of allowances to emit sulfur dioxide that the owner or
operator or designated representative hold for the unit.

including ambient air quality standards.
(3) The use of any allowance prior to the year for which
it is allocated.
(4) Contravention of any other provision of the permit.
(6.5 added July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)
Section 6.6. Hazardous Air Pollutants.--(a) The regulations
establishing performance or emission standards promulgated under
section 112 of the Clean Air Act are incorporated by reference
into the department's permitting program. After the effective
date of the performance or emission standard, new,
reconstructed, modified and existing sources shall comply with
the performance or emission standards pursuant to the compliance
schedule established under section 112 of the Clean Air Act and
the regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act. The
Environmental Quality Board may not establish a more stringent
performance or emission standard for hazardous air pollutant
emissions from existing sources, except as provided in
subsection (d). This section shall not apply to rules and
regulations adopted as final prior to the effective date of
this act and shall not be construed to weaken standards for
individual sources or facilities in effect prior to the
effective date of this act. The board may establish performance
or emission standards for sources or categories of sources which
are not included on the list of source categories established
under section 112(c) of the Clean Air Act. For purposes of this
section, the term "performance standard" includes design,
equipment, work practice or operational standards or any
combination thereof.

(b) In the event the administrator has not promulgated a
standard to control the emissions of hazardous air pollutants
for a category or subcategory of major sources under section
112 of the Clean Air Act, pursuant to a schedule established
pursuant to section 112(c) of the Clean Air Act, the department
shall have the authority to establish a performance or emission
standard on a case-by-case basis for individual sources or a
category of sources. The department shall have the authority
to make the determinations required by section 112(g) (2) of the
Clean Air Act regarding the construction, reconstruction and
modification of sources. Any person challenging the performance
or emission standards established by the department shall have
the burden to demonstrate that the performance or emission
standard does not meet the requirements of section 112 of the
Clean Air Act. The department shall incorporate the standard
to control the emissions of hazardous air pollutants into the
plan approval or operating permit of any source within the
category or subcategory. The performance or emission standard
established on a case-by-case basis by the department shall be
equivalent to the limitation that would apply to the source if
a performance or emission standard had been promulgated by the
administrator under section 112 of the Clean Air Act.
(c) The department is authorized to require that new sources
demonstrate in the plan approval application that the source
will reduce or control emissions of air pollutants, including
hazardous air pollutants, by using the best available
technology.
(d) (1) When needed to protect public health, welfare and
the environment from emissions of hazardous air pollutants from
new and existing sources, the department may impose health

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 66

risk-based emission standards or operating practice
requirements. In developing such health risk-based emission
standards or operating practice requirements, the department
shall provide an explanation and rationale for such standards
or requirements and provide for public review and comments on
plan approvals, operating permits, guidelines and regulations
which contain health risk-based emission standards or operating
practice requirements. Standards or requirements adopted
pursuant to this subsection shall be developed using an analysis
which, among other factors, considers, where appropriate for a
source or source category, the criteria set forth in section
112(f) (1) of the Clean Air Act in assessing the proposed risk
to the public health, welfare and the environment from the
source.

(2) In the case of coke oven batteries, the department may
not impose health risk-based emission standards more stringent
than Federal requirements until eight (8) years after
promulgation of maximum achievable control technology (MACT)
standards and not until the year 2020 for coke oven batteries
which satisfy the requirements of section 112(1) (8) (A) of the
Clean Air Act.

(3) Notwithstanding the limitation in clause (2), where the
operation of a coke oven battery would result in serious,
substantial and demonstrable harm to public health, welfare and
the environment, the department may impose health risk-based
emission standards by regulation which utilize proven,
commercially available and economically available methods of
technology.

(i) The department shall not impose health risk-based
emission standards until after January 1, 1998, for those coke
oven batteries which satisfy the applicable MACT or lowest
achievable emission rate (LAER) standards.

(ii) After January 1, 1998, the department shall only impose
health risk-based emission standards adopted pursuant to section
112(f) of the Clean Air Act, and, if no such emission standards
are adopted pursuant to section 112(f) of the Clean Air Act,
the department may adopt such emission standards, provided that
such standards are consistent with the criteria and the factors
set forth in clause (1) and section 112(f) of the Clean Air Act
and until such time as health risk-based standards are enacted
by the Federal Government pursuant to section 112(f) of the
Clean Air Act.

(e) The department shall have the authority to require, in
the plan approval and operating permit, reasonable monitoring,
recordkeeping and reporting requirements for sources which emit
hazardous air pollutants.

(f) Nothing in this section shall preclude the department
from taking an emergency action where there is an immediate or
potential threat to public health, welfare and the environment
from an air pollutant, including a hazardous air pollutant.

(g) The early emissions reduction program authorized under
section 112(i) (5) of the Clean Air Act is incorporated by
reference in the department's permitting program.

it becomes necessary to adopt rules and regulations for the
control, abatement, prevention or reduction of air pollution
for more than one region of the Commonwealth, the board may
hold one hearing for any two contiguous regions to be affected
by such rules and regulations. Such hearing may be held in
either of the two contiguous regions. In the case where it
becomes necessary to adopt rules and regulations for the
control, abatement, prevention or reduction of air pollution
for any area of the Commonwealth which encompasses more than
one region or parts of more than one region, public hearings
shall be held in the area concerned. Full stenographic
transcripts shall be taken of all public hearings and shall be
made available by the department to any party concerned with
the subject matter of the hearing upon the payment of prevailing
rates for such transcripts.

(b) In addition to the matters discussed at the public
hearings, the board may, in its discretion, solicit the views,
in writing, of persons who may be affected by, or interested
in, proposed rules and regulations.

Reauthorization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-499, 100 Stat. 1613)
that is not listed in section 112 of the Clean Air Act and who

for a violation committed after a first conviction of such
person under this clause, the maximum punishment shall be
doubled with respect to both the fine and imprisonment. For any
air pollutant for which the board has set an emissions standard
or for any source for which a permit has been issued by the
department, a release of such pollutant in accordance with that
standard or permit shall not constitute a violation of this
section.

(2) In determining whether a defendant who is an individual
knew that the violation placed another person in imminent danger
of death or serious bodily injury:

(i) the defendant is responsible only for actual awareness
or actual belief possessed; and

(ii) knowledge possessed by a person other than the
defendant, but not by the defendant, may not be attributed to
the defendant, except that, in proving a defendant's possession
of actual knowledge, circumstantial evidence may be used,
including evidence that the defendant took affirmative steps
to be shielded from relevant information.

(3) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under
this subsection that the conduct charged was freely consented
to by the person endangered and that the danger and conduct
charged were reasonably foreseeable hazards of either of the
following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 78

(i) An occupation, a business or a profession and the person
had been made aware of the risks involved prior to giving
consent.
(ii) Medical treatment or medical or scientific
experimentation conducted by professionally approved methods
and such other person had been made aware of the risks involved
prior to giving consent. The defendant may establish an
affirmative defense under this subclause by a preponderance of
the evidence.
(4) All general defenses, affirmative defenses and bars to
prosecution that may apply with respect to other State criminal
offenses may apply under this clause and shall be determined
by the courts according to the principles of common law.
Concepts of justification and excuse applicable under this
section may be developed according to those principles.
(5) For purposes of this subsection, the term "organization"
means a legal entity, other than a government, established or
organized for any purpose, and the term includes a corporation,
a company, an association, a firm, a partnership, a joint stock
company, a foundation, an institution, a trust, a society, a
union or any other association of persons.
(d) For purposes of subsections (b) and (c) of this section,
the term "serious bodily injury" means bodily injury which
involves a substantial risk of death, unconsciousness, extreme
physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement or
protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily
member, organ or mental faculty.
(e) For purposes of this section, the term "person"
includes, in addition to the entities referred to in section

management personnel or a corporate officer. Except in the case
of knowing and wilful violations, such term shall not include
any person who is a stationary engineer or technician
responsible for the operation, maintenance, repair or monitoring
of equipment and facilities and who often has supervisory and
training duties, but who is not senior management personnel or
a corporate officer. Except in the case of knowing and wilful
violations, for purposes of clause (3) of subsection (b) of
this section, the term "a person" shall not include an employe
who is carrying out his normal activities and who is not a part
of senior management personnel or a corporate officer. Except
in the case of knowing and wilful violations, for the purposes
of clauses (1) and (2) of subsection (b) and subsection (c) of
this section, the term "a person" shall not include an employe
who is carrying out his normal activities and who is acting
under orders from the employer.
(g) For purposes of this section, a person acts negligently
with respect to a material element of an offense when he should
be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the
material element exists or will result from his conduct. The
risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's
failure to perceive it, considering the nature and intent of
his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross
deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person
would observe in the actor's situation.
(9 amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)
Section 9.1. Civil Penalties.--(a) In addition to
proceeding under any other remedy available at law or in equity
for a violation of a provision of this act or any rule or

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 79

regulation promulgated under this act or any order, plan
approval or permit issued pursuant to this act, the department
may assess a civil penalty for the violation. The penalty may
be assessed whether or not the violation was wilful. The civil
penalty so assessed shall not exceed ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00) per day for each violation which occurs in the
first three (3) years following enactment of this section,
fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) per day for each violation
which occurs in the fourth year following enactment of this
section and twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per day
for each violation which occurs in the fifth year and all
subsequent years following enactment of this section. In
determining the amount of the penalty, the department shall
consider the wilfulness of the violation; damage to air, soil,
water or other natural resources of the Commonwealth or their
uses; financial benefit to the person in consequence of the
violation; deterrence of future violations; cost to the
department; the size of the source or facility; the compliance
history of the source; the severity and duration of the
violation; degree of cooperation in resolving the violation;
the speed with which compliance is ultimately achieved; whether
the violation was voluntarily reported; other factors unique
to the owners or operator of the source or facility; and other
relevant factors.

(b) When the department proposes to assess a civil penalty,
it shall inform the person of the proposed amount of the
penalty. The person charged with the penalty shall then have
thirty (30) days to pay the proposed penalty in full, or, if
the person wishes to contest the amount of the penalty or the
fact of the violation to the extent not already established,
the person shall forward the proposed amount of the penalty to
the hearing board within the thirty (30) day period for
placement in an escrow account with the State Treasurer or any
Commonwealth bank or post an appeal bond to the hearing board
within thirty (30) days in the amount of the proposed penalty,
provided that such bond is executed by a surety licensed to do
business in the Commonwealth and is satisfactory to the
department. If, through administrative or final judicial review
of the proposed penalty, it is determined that no violation
occurred or that the amount of the penalty shall be reduced,
the hearing board shall, within thirty (30) days, remit the
appropriate amount to the person with any interest accumulated
by the escrow deposit. Failure to forward the money or the
appeal bond at the time of the appeal shall result in a waiver
of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of
the civil penalty unless the appellant alleges financial
inability to prepay the penalty or to post the appeal bond. The
hearing board shall conduct a hearing to consider the
appellant's alleged inability to pay within thirty (30) days
of the date of the appeal. The hearing board may waive the
requirement to prepay the civil penalty or to post an appeal
bond if the appellant demonstrates and the hearing board finds
that the appellant is financially unable to pay. The hearing
board shall issue an order within thirty (30) days of the date
of the hearing to consider the appellant's alleged inability
to pay. The amount assessed after administrative hearing or
after waiver of administrative hearing shall be payable to the
Commonwealth and shall be collectible in any manner provided
by law for the collection of debts, including the collection
of interest at the rate established in subsection (c) of section
6.3, which shall run from the date of assessment of the penalty.
If any person liable to pay any such penalty neglects or refuses

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 80

to pay the same after demand, the amount, together with interest
and any costs that may accrue, shall constitute a debt of such
person, as may be appropriate, to the Clean Air Fund. The debt
shall constitute a lien on all property owned by said person
when a notice of lien incorporating a description of the
property of the person subject to the action is duly filed with
the prothonotary of the court of common pleas where the property
is located. The prothonotary shall promptly enter upon the civil
judgment or order docket, at no cost to the department, the
name and address of the person, as may be appropriate, and the
amount of the lien as set forth in the notice of lien. Upon
entry by the prothonotary, the lien shall attach to the revenues
and all real and personal property of the person, whether or
not the person is solvent. The notice of lien, filed pursuant
to this subsection, which affects the property of the person
shall create a lien with priority over all subsequent claims
or liens which are filed against the person, but it shall not
affect any valid lien, right or interest in the property filed
in accordance with established procedure prior to the filing
of a notice of lien under this subsection.
(9.1 amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)

(3) Within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the
department's notification of the municipality under clause (2),
the municipality shall submit a project proposal to the

release twenty-five per centum (25%) of the fine or civil
penalty collected to the municipality. If the cost of the
project exceeds twenty-five per centum (25%) of the fine or
civil penalty, the department may award additional money from
the fine or civil penalty to the municipality.
(5) If all fines and civil penalties deposited into the
Clean Air Fund are less than one million eight hundred fifty
thousand dollars ($1,850,000) for the previous fiscal year,

period, the county in which the violation occurred may submit
a project proposal in compliance with clause (1) to the
department for review and approval within forty-five (45) days
of the expiration of the one hundred eighty (180) day period.
(a.2) Within five (5) business days of imposition of a fine
or civil penalty under this act, the department shall notify
the municipality in which the violation occurred of the
violation.

from the General Assembly, the Federal, State or local
government or any private source.
(c) The Clean Air Fund shall not be subject to 42 Pa.C.S.
Ch. 37 Subch. C (relating to judicial computer system).

Section 9.3. Continuing Violations.--Each day of continued
violation and each violation of any provision of this act, any

the permittee or any person is in violation of any provision
of this act or of any rule, regulation or order of the
department.
(b) The department may, in its order, require compliance
with such conditions as are necessary to prevent or abate air

(b) The administrative procedures for the abatement,
reduction, prevention and control of air pollution set forth
in this act shall not apply to any county of the first or second
class of the Commonwealth which has and implements an air
pollution control program that, at a minimum, meets the
requirements of this act, the Clean Air Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated under both this act and the Clean Air
Act and has been approved by the department.

(b.1) Provisions of this act pertaining to dust control
measures shall not apply to portions of highways in townships
of the second class where no businesses or residences are
located. ((b.1) added Nov. 28, 1995, P.L.645, No.68)

(c)
(1) Whenever, either upon complaint made to or
initiated by the department, the department finds that any
person is in violation of air pollution control standards, or

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 83

rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the grant of
authority made in subsection (b), the department shall give
notification of that fact to that person and to the air
pollution control agency of the county involved.
(2) If such violation continues to exist after said
notification has been given, the department may take any
abatement action provided for under the terms of this act.
(d) Whenever the department finds that violations of this
act or the rules and regulations promulgated under this act are
so widespread that such violations appear to result from a
failure of the local county control agency involved to enforce
those requirements, the department may assume the authority to
enforce this act in that county.
(e) The department shall have the power to refuse approval,
or to suspend or rescind approval, once given, to any county
air pollution control agency if the department finds that such
county agency is unable or unwilling to conduct an air pollution
control program to abate or reduce air pollution problems within
its jurisdiction in accordance with the requirements of this
act, the Clean Air Act or the rules and regulations promulgated
under both this act and the Clean Air Act.
(f) Whenever the department takes action under the
provisions of subsections (d) or (e) of this section, it shall
give written notification to the air pollution control agency
of the county involved and such notification shall be an
appealable action.
(g) Irrespective of subsection (b) above, and in order that
the civil and criminal penalties and equitable remedies for air
pollution violations shall be uniform throughout the
Commonwealth, the penalties and remedies set forth in this act
shall be the penalties and remedies available for enforcement
of any municipal air pollution ordinances or regulations, and
shall be available to any municipality, public official, or
other person having standing to initiate proceedings for the
enforcement of such municipal ordinances or regulations, and
the amounts of the fines or civil penalties set forth herein
shall be the amounts of the fines or civil penalties assessable
and to be levied for violations of any municipal ordinances or
regulations. It is hereby declared to be the purpose of this
section to enunciate further that the purpose of this act is
to provide additional and cumulative remedies to abate the
pollution of the air of this Commonwealth. Any action for the
assessment of civil penalties brought for the enforcement of a
municipal air pollution ordinance or regulation shall be brought
in accordance with the procedures set forth in such ordinance.
Where any municipal ordinance or regulation does not provide a
procedure for the assessment of civil penalties, the provisions
related to assessment and collection of civil penalties of
section 9.1 shall apply.
(h) Nothing in this act shall affect the Municipal Planning
Code unless required by the Clean Air Act.
(12 amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)
Section 12.1. Construction.--Nothing in this act shall be
construed as estopping the Commonwealth, or any district
attorney or solicitor of a municipality, from proceeding in
courts of law or equity to abate pollutions forbidden under
this act, or abate nuisances under existing law. It is hereby
declared to be the purpose of this act to provide additional
and cumulative remedies to abate the pollution of the air of
this Commonwealth, and nothing contained in this act shall in
any way abridge or alter rights of action or remedies now or
hereafter existing in equity, or under the common law or

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 84

statutory law, criminal or civil, nor shall any provision of
this act, or the granting of any plan approval or permit under
this act, or any act done by virtue of this act, be construed
as estopping the Commonwealth, persons or municipalities, in
the exercise of their rights under the common law or decisional
law or in equity, from proceeding in courts of law or equity
to suppress nuisances, or to abate any pollution now or
hereafter existing, or enforce common law or statutory rights.
No courts of this Commonwealth having jurisdiction to abate
public or private nuisance shall be deprived of such
jurisdiction to abate any private or public nuisance instituted
by any person for the reason that such nuisance constitutes air
pollution.
(12.1 amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)
Section 13. Public Nuisances.--A violation of this act or
of any rule or regulation promulgated under this act or any
order, plan approval or permit issued by the department under
this act shall constitute a public nuisance. The department
shall have the authority to order any person causing a public
nuisance to abate the public nuisance. In addition, the
department or any Commonwealth agency which undertakes to abate
a public nuisance may recover the expenses of abatement
following the process for assessment and collection of a civil
penalty contained in section 9.1. Whenever the nuisance is
maintained or continued contrary to this act or any rule or
regulation promulgated under this act or any order, plan
approval or permit, the nuisance may be abatable in the manner
provided by this act. Any person who causes the public nuisance
shall be liable for the cost of abatement.
(13 amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)
Section 13.1. Search Warrants.--Whenever an agent or employe
of the department, charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this act, has been refused access to property,
or has been refused the right to examine any air contamination
source, or air pollution control equipment or device, or is
refused access to or examination of books, papers and records
pertinent to any matter under investigation, such agent or
employe may apply for a search warrant to any Commonwealth
official authorized by the laws of the Commonwealth to issue
the same to enable him to have access, examine and seize such
property, air contamination source, air pollution control
equipment or device, or books, papers and records, as the case
may be. It shall be sufficient probable cause to issue a search
warrant that the inspection is necessary to properly enforce
the provisions of this act.
(13.1 amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)
Section 13.2. Confidential Information.--All records,
reports or information obtained by the department or referred
to at public hearings under the provisions of this act shall
be available to the public, except that upon cause shown by any
person that the records, reports or information, or a particular
portion thereof, but not emission data, to which the department
has access under the provisions of this act, if made public,
would divulge production or sales figures or methods, processes
or production unique to such person or would otherwise tend to
affect adversely the competitive position of such person by
revealing trade secrets, including intellectual property rights,
the department shall consider such record, report or
information, or particular portion thereof confidential in the
administration of this act. The department shall implement this
section consistent with sections 112 (d) and 114(c) of the Clean
Air Act. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent disclosure

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 85

of such report, record or information to Federal, State or local
representatives as necessary for purposes of administration of
any Federal, State or local air pollution control laws, or when
relevant in any proceeding under this act.
(13.2 amended July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)

Approvals.-- (13.3 repealed July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)
Section 13.4. Public Nuisances.--(13.4 repealed July 9,
1992, P.L.460, No.95)
Section 13.5. Variances.--(13.5 repealed July 9, 1992,
P.L.460, No.95)
Section 13.6. Suits to Abate Nuisances and Restrain
Violations.--(a) Any activity or condition declared by this
act to be a nuisance or which is otherwise in violation of this
act shall be abatable in the manner provided by law or equity
for the abatement of public nuisance. In addition, in order to
restrain or prevent any violation of this act or the rules and
regulations promulgated under this act or any plan approval or
permit or orders issued by the department or to restrain the
maintenance and threat of public nuisance, suits may be
instituted in equity or at law in the name of the Commonwealth
upon relation of the Attorney General, the General Counsel, the
district attorney of any county or the solicitor of any
municipality affected after notice has first been served upon
the Attorney General of the intention of the General Counsel,
district attorney or solicitor to so proceed. Such proceedings
may be prosecuted in the Commonwealth Court or in the court of
common pleas of the county where the activity has taken place,
the condition exists or the public is affected, and, to that
end, jurisdiction is hereby conferred in law and equity upon
such courts. Except in cases of emergency where, in the opinion
of the court, the exigencies of the case require immediate
abatement of the nuisance, the court may, in its decree, fix a
reasonable time during which the person responsible for the
nuisance may make provision for the abatement of the same.
(b) In cases where the circumstances require it or the
public health is endangered, a mandatory preliminary injunction
special injunction or temporary restraining order may be issued
upon the terms prescribed by the court, notice of the
application therefor having been given to the defendant in
accordance with the rules of equity practice, and, in any such
case, the Attorney General, the General Counsel, the district
attorney or the solicitor of any municipality shall not be
required to give bond. In any such proceeding the court shall,
upon motion of the Commonwealth, issue a prohibitory or
mandatory preliminary injunction if it finds that the defendant
is engaging in unlawful conduct as defined by this act or is
engaged in conduct which is causing immediate and irreparable
harm to the public. In addition to an injunction, the court in
such equity proceedings may levy civil penalties in the same
manner as the department in accordance with section 9.1.
(c) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section,
any person may commence a civil action to compel compliance
with this act or any rule, regulation, order or plan approval
or permit issued pursuant to this act by any owner or operator
alleged to be causing or contributing to a violation of any
provision of this act or any rule or regulation promulgated
under this act or any plan approval, permit or order issued by
the department. In addition to seeking to compel compliance,
any person may request the court to award civil penalties. The
court shall use the factors and amounts contained in section
9.1 in awarding civil penalties under this subsection. Such

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Page 86

penalties shall be paid into the Clean Air Fund established by
section 9.2 or be used to prevent air pollution in the county
where the violation occurred. Except where 42 Pa.C.S. (relating
to judiciary and judicial procedure) requires otherwise, the
courts of common pleas shall have jurisdiction of such actions.
Such an action may not be commenced if the department has
commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil action in a
Federal or State court or is in litigation before the hearing
board to require the alleged violator to comply with this act,
any rule or regulation promulgated under this act or any order,
plan approval or permit issued pursuant to this act, but, in
any such action in a Federal or State court or before the
hearing board, any person having or representing an interest
which is or may be adversely affected may intervene as a matter
of right without posting bond.

(d) An action pursuant to subsection (c) of this section
may not be commenced prior to sixty (60) days after the
plaintiff has given notice in writing of the violation to the
department and to any alleged violator.

(e) The sixty (60) day notice provisions of subsection (d)
of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, any action
pursuant to subsection (c) of this section may be initiated
immediately upon written notification to the department in the
case where the violation or condition complained of constitutes
an imminent threat to the health or safety of the plaintiff or
would immediately affect a legal interest of the plaintiff.

(f) The court, in issuing any final order in any action
brought pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, may award
costs of litigation, including attorney and expert witness fees,
to any party whenever the court determines such an award is
appropriate. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this
section, the court may, if a temporary restraining order or
preliminary injunction is sought, require the filing of a bond
or equivalent security in accordance with the Pennsylvania Rules
of Civil Procedure.

(13.6 added July 9, 1992, P.L.460, No.95)

Section 14. Severability.--The provisions of this act are
severable and if any provision, sentence, clause, section or
part thereof shall be held illegal, invalid, unconstitutional
or inapplicable to any person or circumstances, such illegality,
invalidity, unconstitutionality or inapplicability shall not
affect or impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences,
clauses, sections or parts of the ordinance or their application
to him or to other persons and circumstances. It is hereby
declared to be the legislative intent that this act would have
been adopted if such illegal, invalid or unconstitutional
provision, sentence, clause, section or part had not been
included therein, and if the person or circumstances to which
the ordinance or any part thereof is inapplicable had not
specifically been exempted therefrom.

Section 15. Effective Date.--This act shall take effect
immediately: Provided, however, That the rules and regulations
promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this act shall be of
no effect until one (1) year after the passage of this act.

The Honorable E. Christopher Abruzzo, Acting Secretary
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
Rachel Carson State Office Building
P.O. Box 2063
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17105-2063

Dear Secretary Abruzzo:

DEC 10 2013

By letter and enclosures dated July 23, 2013, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection (PADEP) submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) an annual ambient
air monitoring network plan in accordance with the regulatory requirements of 40 CFR Section 58 -
Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. Based on our review, EPA hereby approves PADEP's July 23, 2013
annual ambient air monitoring network plan on the basis that the plan meets the requirements of 40 CFR
Part 58.10.

Additionally, 40 CFR Section 58.11(c) requires any changes to the air monitoring network or
design of the following air monitoring systems be approved by the EPA Administrator:

a) Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Systems (PAMS)
b) Particulate Matter Speciation Trends Network (STN)
c) The National Core Monitoring Network (NCore)

EPA determined that PADEP's July 23, 2013 annual ambient air monitoring network plan does
not require approval from the EPA Administrator because there were no changes to any of the air
monitoring systems listed above.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me or have your staff contact
Mrs. Laura Mohollen, EPA's Pennsylvania Liaison, at (215) 814-3295. For questions regarding this
approval action, your staff may contact Ms. Diana Esher, Director, Air Protection Division, at

Dear Mr. Thompson:

By letter and enclosures dated July 1, 2013, the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD)
submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) an annual ambient air monitoring
network plan in accordance with the regulatory requirements of 40 CFR Part 58 - Ambient Air Quality
Surveillance. Based on our review, EPA approves ACHD's July 1, 2013 annual ambient air monitoring

Dr. Donald F. Schwarz, MD, MPH, Health Commissioner
City of Philadelphia
Department of Public Health
1401 JFK Boulevard, Room 600
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102

DEC 10 2013

Dear Dr. Schwarz:

By letter and enclosures dated July 1, 2013, the City of Philadelphia Air Management Services
(AMS) submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) an annual ambient air monitoring
network plan in accordance with the regulatory requirements of 40 CFR Part 58 - Ambient Air Quality
Surveillance. Based on our review, EPA partially approves AMS's July 1, 2013 annual ambient air
monitoring network plan on the basis that the plan meets the requirements of 40 CFR Part 58.10. EPA
also approves your request for exclusion of the PM2.5 continuous FEM data from site 42-101-0004 as
per 40 CFR Part 58.11(e).

Additionally, 40 CFR Section 58.11(c) requires any changes to the air monitoring network or
design of the following air monitoring systems be approved by the EPA Administrator:

a) Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Systems (PAMS)
b) Particulate Matter Speciation Trends Network (STN)
c) The National Core Monitoring Network (NCore)

EPA determined that AMS's July 1, 2013 annual ambient air monitoring network plan requires a
separate approval from the EPA Administrator because of the relocation of the NCore monitoring site.
As such, AMS's 2013 monitoring network plan has been forwarded to EPA's Office of Air Quality
Planning and Standards to complete the approval process.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me or have your staff contact
Mrs. Laura Mohollen, EPA's Pennsylvania Liaison, at (215) 814-3295. For questions regarding this
approval action, your staff may contact Ms. Diana Esher, Director, Air Protection Division, at
