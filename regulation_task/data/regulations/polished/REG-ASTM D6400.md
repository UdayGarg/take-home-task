## Standard Specification for Labeling of Plastics Designed to be Aerobically Composted in Municipal or Industrial Facilities

This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides, and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

**Designation: D6400 – 23**

This standard is issued under the fixed designation D6400; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.

### 1. Scope

1.1 This specification covers plastics and products made from plastics that are designed to be composted under aerobic conditions in municipal and industrial aerobic composting facilities, where thermophilic conditions are achieved.

1.2 This specification is intended to establish the requirements for labeling of materials and products, including packaging made from plastics, as "compostable in aerobic municipal and industrial composting facilities."

1.3 The properties in this specification are those required to determine if end items (including packaging), which use plastics and polymers as coatings or binders, will compost satisfactorily in large-scale aerobic municipal or industrial composting facilities. Maximum throughput is a high priority to composters, and the intermediate stages of plastic disintegration and biodegradation should not be visible to the end user for aesthetic reasons.

1.4 The following safety hazards caveat pertains to the test methods portion of this standard: This standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.

*Note 1—This test method is equivalent to ISO 17088.*

1.5 This international standard was developed in accordance with internationally recognized principles on standardization established in the Decision on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides, and Recommendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

## Terminology

### Definitions

Definitions appearing in this specification are found in Terminology D883, unless otherwise noted.

- **Biodegradable Plastic:** A degradable plastic in which the degradation results from the action of naturally occurring microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae.

- **Compostable Plastic:** A plastic that undergoes degradation by biological processes during composting to yield CO<sub>2</sub>, water, inorganic compounds, and biomass at a rate consistent with other known compostable materials and leaves no visible, distinguishable, or toxic residue.

- **Composting:** A managed process that controls the biological decomposition and transformation of biodegradable materials into a humus-like substance called compost. It involves the aerobic mesophilic and thermophilic degradation of organic matter to make compost, transforming biologically decomposable material through a controlled process of biooxidation that proceeds through mesophilic and thermophilic phases, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide, water, minerals, and stabilized organic matter (compost or humus).

- **Degradable Plastic:** A plastic designed to undergo a significant change in its chemical structure under specific environmental conditions, resulting in a loss of properties as measured by standard test methods appropriate to the plastic and the application in a period of time that determines its classification.

### 3. Definitions

3.1.5 **Plastic** — A material that contains as an essential ingredient one or more organic polymeric substances of large molecular weight, is solid in its finished state, and, at some stage in its manufacture or processing into finished articles, can be shaped by flow.

3.1.6 **Polymer** — A substance consisting of molecules characterized by the repetition (neglecting ends, branch junctions, other minor irregularities) of one or more types of monomeric units.

3.1.7 **Volatile Organic Solids** — Amount of organic matter present determined as the ratio of the difference between the dry mass of test sample and the mass remaining after incineration at 550 °C by the dry mass of test sample.

### 4. Classification

4.1 The purpose of this specification is to establish requirements for identifying items made from plastics or polymers so that they do not interfere with their satisfactorily composting in commercial and municipal aerobic composting facilities. Products meeting the requirements outlined below can be labeled as "compostable in municipal or industrial aerobic facilities" in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Federal Trade Commission as long as proper qualifications as to the availability of such facilities are included on the label.

### 5. Basic Requirements

5.1 In order to compost satisfactorily, a product or material must demonstrate each of the characteristics found in 5.1.1 – 5.1.3, which are quantified in Section 6.

- **5.1.1 Disintegration During Composting** — A plastic product or material will disintegrate during composting such that any remaining plastic residuals are not readily distinguishable from the other organic materials in the finished product. Additionally, the material or product must not be found in significant quantities during screening prior to final distribution of the compost.

- **5.1.2 Biodegradation** — A level of biodegradation for the plastic products shall be established by tests under controlled conditions.

- **5.1.3 No Adverse Impacts on Ability of Compost to Support Plant Growth** — The tested materials shall not adversely impact the ability of composts to support plant growth when compared to composts derived from biowaste without any addition of tested products or reference materials. Additionally, the polymeric products or materials must not introduce unacceptable levels of regulated metals or hazardous substances into the environment upon sample decomposition.

*Note 2: For a better understanding of why these criteria are important, consult the Compost Facility Operating Guide, and CEN/TC 261/SC 4 N 99.*

### 6. Detailed Requirements

6.1 In order to be identified as compostable in municipal or industrial aerobic facilities, products must pass the requirements of 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 using the appropriate laboratory tests.

Guidelines for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC, 1992.

# ASTM D6400 - 23

The document outlines the standards for testing the compostability of plastic products under conditions representative of aerobic composting facilities, which reach thermophilic temperatures. Finished articles and products should be tested in the form they are intended to be used. For products made in multiple thicknesses or densities, such as films, containers, and foams, only the thickest or most dense products need to be tested, provided the chemical composition and structure remain otherwise the same. It is assumed that thinner gauges and lower densities will also compost satisfactorily. Similarly, if additives are present in test samples that pass testing, lower levels of the same additives are similarly passed.

## 6.2 Disintegration During Composting

A plastic product is considered to have demonstrated satisfactory disintegration if, after twelve weeks (84 days) in a controlled composting test, no more than 10% of its original dry weight remains after sieving on a 2.0-mm sieve. The test shall be carried out in accordance with ISO 16929 with a minimum vessel volume of 35 L, or ISO 20200 under thermophilic aerobic composting conditions.

## 6.3 Biodegradation

A plastic product must demonstrate a satisfactory rate of biodegradation by achieving the following ratio of conversion to carbon dioxide within 180 days using Test Method D5338, ISO 14855-1, or ISO 14855-2.

### 6.3.1

Ninety percent (90%) of the organic carbon in the whole item or for each organic constituent, which is present in the material at a concentration of more than 1% (by dry mass), shall be converted to carbon dioxide by the end of the test period when compared to the positive control or in the absolute.

#### 6.3.1.1

Organic constituents present at levels between 1 to 10% shall be tested individually for compliance with 6.3.1.

### 6.3.2

Organic constituents present at concentrations of less than 1% do not need to demonstrate biodegradability. However, the sum of such unproven constituents shall not exceed 5%.

### 6.3.3

Ligno-cellulosic substrates are permitted to fulfill the requirements of 6.3 by demonstrating that they are "materials of natural origin" as defined in Specification D6868, and therefore assumed to be biodegradable by showing that over 95% of their carbon comes from biobased resources, using Test Methods D6866. Any polymers or additives derived from biobased sources that are blended with ligno-cellulosic substrates shall separately demonstrate that they meet the requirements of 6.3 if they are more than 1% of the dry weight of the end item.

### 6.3.4

Plastic product test samples shall not be subjected to conditions designed to accelerate biodegradation prior to testing in 6.3.

> **Note 3:** While the endpoints of biodegradation include incorporation into biomass or humic substances as well as carbon dioxide, no recognized standard test methods and specifications exist to quantify these outcomes. When these tests and specifications become available, this standard will be revised.

## 6.4 Terrestrial Safety

A plastic or product demonstrates satisfactory terrestrial safety if it fulfills all the requirements in 6.4.1, 6.4.2, and 6.4.3:

### 6.4.1

The plastic or product shall have concentrations of regulated metals less than 50% of those prescribed for sludges or composts in the country where the product is sold. Specifically, in the United States, the regulated metal concentrations are found in Table 3 of 40 CFR Part 503.13. In Canada, the regulated metals concentrations are found in Table 1 for Compost Category A in Guidelines for Compost Quality published by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME), and Category AA of the Ontario Compost Quality Standards, published by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment.

### 6.4.2

The germination rate and the plant biomass of the sample composts shall be no less than 90% that of the corresponding blank composts for two different plant species following OECD Guideline 208 with the modifications found in Annex E of EN 13432.

> **Note 4:** Sample composts generated in accordance with ISO 20200 should not be used for ecotoxicity testing unless the concentration of the test items at the start of testing is in accordance with the requirements of ISO 16929.

### 6.4.3

The plastic or product must contain at least 50% volatile organic solids content. This is determined by subtracting the residue of a known mass of test sample after incineration at 550°C from the total dry solids of the same sample, according to Standard Method 2540G:

\[ \% \text{ volatile organic solids} = \left(\frac{\text{Mass of dried residue - Mass of residue after ignition}}{\text{Mass of dried residue}}\right) \times 100 \]

Where: "Mass of dried residue" (in milligrams) is the dry mass of the test sample used in the incineration test.
