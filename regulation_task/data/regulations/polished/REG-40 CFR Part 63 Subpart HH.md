## Subpart HH - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Oil and Natural Gas Production Facilities

**Source:** 64 FR 32628, June 17, 1999, unless otherwise noted.

### § 63.760 Applicability and designation of affected source.

(a) This subpart applies to the owners and operators of the emission points, specified in paragraph (b) of this section that are located at oil and natural gas production facilities that meet the specified criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and either (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.

# Facilities and Emissions Regulations

## Major or Area Sources of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP)

Facilities that are major or area sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) are defined in §63.761. Emissions for major source determination purposes can be estimated using the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput, as appropriate, calculated in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. As an alternative to calculating the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput, the owner or operator of a new or existing source may use the facility's design maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput to estimate the maximum potential emissions. Other means to determine the facility's major source status are allowed, provided the information is documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction in accordance with §63.10(b)(3). A facility that is determined to be an area source, but subsequently increases its emissions or its potential to emit above the major source levels, and becomes a major source, must comply thereafter with all provisions of this subpart applicable to a major source starting on the applicable compliance date specified in paragraph (f) of this section. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to preclude a source from limiting its potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the permitting authority.

### Determining Maximum Throughput

(i) If the owner or operator documents, to the Administrator's satisfaction, a decline in annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput, as appropriate, each year for the 5 years prior to October 15, 2012, the owner or operator shall calculate the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput used to determine maximum potential emissions according to the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. In all other circumstances, the owner or operator shall calculate the maximum throughput used to determine whether a facility is a major source in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

- **(A)** The maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is the average of the annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput for the 3 years prior to October 15, 2012, multiplied by a factor of 1.2.

- **(B)** The maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is the highest annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput over the 5 years prior to October 15, 2012, multiplied by a factor of 1.2.

(ii) The owner or operator shall maintain records of the annual facility natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput each year and upon request submit such records to the Administrator. If the facility annual natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput increases above the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput calculated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput must be recalculated using the higher throughput multiplied by a factor of 1.2.

(iii) The owner or operator shall determine the maximum values for other parameters used to calculate emissions as the maximum for the period over which the maximum natural gas or hydrocarbon liquid throughput is determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. Parameters, other than glycol circulation rate, shall be based on either highest measured values or annual average. For estimating maximum potential emissions from glycol dehydration units, the glycol circulation rate used in the calculation shall be the unit's maximum rate under its physical and operational design consistent with the definition of potential to emit in § 63.2.

## Facilities Processing, Upgrading, or Storing Hydrocarbon Liquids

(2) Facilities that process, upgrade, or store hydrocarbon liquids.

# Natural Gas Processing and Storage Regulations

## Facilities and Source Categories

### (3) Facilities

Facilities that process, upgrade, or store natural gas prior to the point at which natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage source category or is delivered to a final end user. For the purposes of this subpart, natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage source category after the natural gas processing plant, when present. If no natural gas processing plant is present, natural gas enters the natural gas transmission and storage source category after the point of custody transfer.

# Definitions

**Facility**  
A *facility* refers to any grouping of equipment where hydrocarbon liquids are processed, upgraded (i.e., impurities or other constituents are removed to meet contract specifications), or stored prior to the point of custody transfer. It also includes locations where natural gas is processed, upgraded, or stored before entering the natural gas transmission and storage source category. For major source determination, a *facility* (including a building, structure, or installation) encompasses oil and natural gas production and processing equipment located within the boundaries of an individual surface site as defined in this section. Equipment at a facility is typically in close proximity to other equipment at the same location. Equipment or groupings located on different oil and gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease tracts, subsurface or surface unit areas, surface fee tracts, surface lease tracts, or separate surface sites, whether connected by a road, waterway, power line, or pipeline, are not considered part of the same facility. Examples include well sites, satellite tank batteries, central tank batteries, compressor stations transporting natural gas to processing plants, and natural gas processing plants.

**Field Natural Gas**  
*Field natural gas* is natural gas extracted from a production well before entering the first stage of processing, such as dehydration.

**Fixed-Roof**  
A *fixed-roof* is a cover mounted on a storage vessel in a stationary manner that does not move with fluctuations in liquid level.

**Flame Zone**  
The *flame zone* is the portion of the combustion chamber in a combustion device occupied by the flame envelope.

**Flare**  
A *flare* is a thermal oxidation system using an open flame (i.e., without enclosure).

**Flash Tank**  
See the definition for gas-condensate-glycol (GCG) separator.

**Flow Indicator**  
A *flow indicator* is a device that indicates whether gas flow is present in a line or whether the valve position would allow gas flow to be present in a line.

**Gas-Condensate-Glycol (GCG) Separator**  
A *gas-condensate-glycol (GCG) separator* is a two or three-phase separator through which the "rich" glycol stream of a glycol dehydration unit is passed to remove entrained gas and hydrocarbon liquid. It is commonly referred to as a flash separator or flash tank.

**Gas-to-Oil Ratio (GOR)**  
The *gas-to-oil ratio (GOR)* is the number of standard cubic meters of gas produced per liter of crude oil or other hydrocarbon liquid.

**Glycol Dehydration Unit**  
A *glycol dehydration unit* is a device where a liquid glycol (including, but not limited to, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or triethylene glycol) absorbent directly contacts a natural gas stream and absorbs water in a contact tower or absorption column (absorber). The glycol absorbs water vapor and other gas stream constituents from the natural gas and becomes "rich" glycol. This glycol is then regenerated in the glycol dehydration unit reboiler. The "lean" glycol is then recycled.

**Glycol Dehydration Unit Baseline Operations**  
*Glycol dehydration unit baseline operations* refer to operations representative of large glycol dehydration unit operations as of June 17, 1999, and small glycol dehydrator unit operations as of August 23, 2011. For determining the percentage of overall HAP emission reduction attributable to process modifications, baseline operations shall be parameter values (including, but not limited to, glycol circulation rate or glycol-HAP absorbency) that represent actual long-term conditions (i.e., at least 1 year). Units in operation for less than 1 year must document that the parameter values represent expected long-term operating conditions had process modifications not been made.

## Glycol Dehydration Unit Process Vent

**Glycol dehydration unit process vent** means the glycol dehydration unit reboiler vent and the vent from the GCG separator (flash tank), if present.

**Glycol dehydration unit reboiler vent** means the vent through which exhaust from the reboiler of a glycol dehydration unit passes from the reboiler to the atmosphere or to a control device.

**Hydrocarbon liquid** means any naturally occurring, unrefined petroleum liquid.

**In VHAP service** means that a piece of ancillary equipment or compressor either contains or contacts a fluid (liquid or gas) which has a total volatile HAP (VHAP) concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight as determined according to the provisions of § 63.772(a).

**In wet gas service** means that a piece of equipment contains or contacts the field gas before the extraction of natural gas liquids.

**Incinerator** means an enclosed combustion device that is used for destroying organic compounds. Auxiliary fuel may be used to heat waste gas to combustion temperatures. Any energy recovery section is not physically formed into one manufactured or assembled unit with the combustion section; rather, the energy recovery section is a separate section following the combustion section and the two are joined by ducts or connections carrying flue gas. The above energy recovery section limitation does not apply to an energy recovery section used solely to preheat the incoming vent stream or combustion air.

**Initial producing GOR** means the producing standard cubic meters of gas per liter at the time that the reservoir pressure is above the bubble point pressure (or dewpoint pressure for a gas).

**Major source**, as used in this subpart, shall have the same meaning as in §63.2, except that:

1. Emissions from any oil or gas exploration or production well (with its associated equipment, as defined in this section), and emissions from any pipeline compressor station or pump station shall not be aggregated with emissions from other similar units to determine whether such emission points or stations are major sources, even when emission points are in a contiguous area or under common control;

2. Emissions from processes, operations, or equipment that are not part of the same facility, as defined in this section, shall not be aggregated; and

3. For facilities that are production field facilities, only HAP emissions from glycol dehydration units and storage vessels shall be aggregated for a major source determination. For facilities that are not production field facilities, HAP emissions from all HAP emission units shall be aggregated for a major source determination.

## § 63.762 Affirmative Defense for Violations of Emission Standards During Malfunction

(a) The provisions set forth in this subpart shall apply at all times.

(b)-(c) [Reserved]

(d) In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined in 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed; however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense, the affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.

1. To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a standard, you must timely meet the reporting requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:

   i. The violation:
   
      A. Was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and
      
      B. Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design, or better operation and maintenance practices; and
      
      C. Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
      
      D. Was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and

   ii. Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when a violation occurred. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable, to make these repairs; and

   iii. The frequency, amount, and duration of the violation (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable; and

   iv. If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and

### Environmental Protection Agency Regulations

#### Affirmative Defense Requirements

(v) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the violation on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health; and

(vi) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and

(vii) All of the actions in response to the violation were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and

(viii) At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and

(ix) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the violation resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of any emissions that were the result of the malfunction.

#### Report

The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall submit a written report to the Administrator with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. This affirmative defense report shall be included in the first periodic compliance, deviation report, or excess emission report otherwise required after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard (which may be the end of any applicable averaging period). If such compliance, deviation report, or excess emission report is due less than 45 days after the initial occurrence of the violation, the affirmative defense report may be included in the second compliance, deviation report, or excess emission report due after the initial occurrence of the violation of the relevant standard.

## Subpart II—National Emission Standards for Shipbuilding and Ship Repair (Surface Coating)

**Source:** 60 FR 64336, Dec. 15, 1995, unless otherwise noted.

### §63.780 Relationship of Subpart II to Subpart A of This Part

Table 1 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A of this part that apply to owners and operators of sources subject to the provisions of this subpart.

### §63.781 Applicability

(a) The provisions of this subpart apply to shipbuilding and ship repair operations at any facility that is a major source.

(b) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to coatings used in volumes of less than 200 liters (52.8 gallons) per year, provided the total volume of coating exempt under this paragraph does not exceed 1,000 liters per year (264 gallons per year) at any facility. Coatings exempt under this paragraph shall be clearly labeled as "low-usage exempt," and the volume of each such coating applied shall be maintained in the facility's records.

(c) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to coatings applied with hand-held, nonrefillable, aerosol containers or to unsaturated polyester resin (i.e., fiberglass lay-up) coatings. Coatings applied to suitably prepared fiberglass surfaces for protective or decorative purposes are subject to this subpart.

(d) If you are authorized in accordance with 40 CFR 63.783(c) to use an add-on control system as an alternative means of limiting emissions from coating operations, in response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards.
