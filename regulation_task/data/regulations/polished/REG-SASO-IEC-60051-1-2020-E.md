# Document on Measurement Terminology

## 3.4 Measurement Characteristics

### 3.4.1 Scale Length
The scale length is the length of the line (curved or straight) which passes through the centers of all the shortest scale marks contained between the first and the last scale marks.

- **Note 1 to entry:** It is expressed in units of length.
- **Note 2 to entry:** If an instrument has more than one scale, each scale may have its own scale length. For convenience, the scale length of the instrument is taken to be that of the major scale.

### 3.4.2 Span
Span is the algebraic difference between the upper and lower limits of the measuring range.

- **Note 1 to entry:** It is expressed in units of the measured quantity.

### 3.4.3 Measuring Range (Effective Range)
The measuring range is defined by two values of the measured quantity within which the limits of uncertainty of a measuring instrument (and/or accessory) are specified.

- **Note 1 to entry:** A measuring instrument (and/or accessory) can have several measuring ranges.

### 3.4.4 Residual Deflection
Residual deflection is the part of the deflection of a mechanically controlled moving element which remains after the cause producing it has disappeared and all the measuring circuits are de-energized.

### 3.4.5 Overshoot
Overshoot is the difference between the extreme indication and the steady indication (expressed in terms of the scale length) when the measured quantity is abruptly changed from one steady value to another.

### 3.4.6 Response Time
Response time is the time taken for the indication to first reach and then remain within a band centered on the final steady indication when the measured quantity is abruptly changed from zero (the unenergized condition) to a value such that the final steady indication is a specified proportion of the scale length.

## 3.5 Characteristic Values

### 3.5.1 Nominal Value
The nominal value is the value of a quantity indicating the intended use of an instrument or accessory. The intended characteristics of instruments and accessories are also nominal values.

### 3.5.2 Rated Value
The rated value is the quantity value assigned by a manufacturer for a specified operating condition of the equipment or instrument.

- **Note 1 to entry:** A rated value \( V \) assigned with an uncertainty \( U \) is actually a range \( V \pm U \) and should be handled as such.
- **Source:** IEC 60359:2001, 3.3.8

### 3.5.3 Fiducial Value
The fiducial value is a clearly specified value of a quantity to which the uncertainty(ies) of an instrument and/or an accessory are referred in order to specify their respective accuracies.

- **Note 1 to entry:** This value can be, for example, the upper limit of the measuring range, the span, or another clearly stated value.

## 3.6 Influence Quantity, Reference Conditions, Nominal Range of Use, and Preconditioning

### 3.6.1 Measurand
The measurand is the quantity subjected to measurement, evaluated in the state assumed by the measured system during the measurement itself.

- **Note 1 to entry:** The value assumed by a quantity subjected to measurement when it is not interacting with the measuring instrument may be called the unperturbed value of the quantity.
- **Note 2 to entry:** The unperturbed value and its associated uncertainty can only be computed through a model of the measured system and of the measurement interaction with the knowledge of the appropriate metrological characteristics of the instrument, which may be called instrumental load.
- **Source:** IEC 60359:2001, 3.1.1

### 3.6.2 Influence Quantity
An influence quantity is a quantity which is not the subject of the measurement and whose change affects the relationship between the indication and the result of the measurement.

- **Note 1 to entry:** Influence quantities can originate from the measured system, the measuring equipment, or the environment.

Note 2 to entry: As the calibration diagram depends on the influence quantities, in order to assign the result of a measurement, it is necessary to know whether the relevant influence quantities lie within the specified range.

Note 3 to entry: An influence quantity is said to lie within a range C' to C" when the results of its measurement satisfy the relationship: C' ≤ V - U < V + U ≤ C".

## 3.7 Uncertainty and Variations

### 3.7.1 (Absolute) Instrumental Uncertainty

Uncertainty of the result of a direct measurement of a measurand having negligible intrinsic uncertainty.

Note 1 to entry: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the instrumental uncertainty is expressed as an interval with coverage factor 2.

Note 2 to entry: In single-reading direct measurements of measurands having intrinsic uncertainty small with respect to the instrumental uncertainty, the uncertainty of the measurement coincides, by definition, with the instrumental uncertainty. Otherwise, the instrumental uncertainty is to be treated as a component of category B in evaluating the uncertainty of the measurement on the basis of the model connecting the several direct measurements involved.

Note 3 to entry: The instrumental uncertainty automatically includes, by definition, the effects due to the quantization of the reading-values (minimum evaluable fraction of the scale interval in analog outputs, unit of the last stable digit in digital outputs).

Note 4 to entry: For material measures, the instrumental uncertainty is the uncertainty that should be associated with the value of the quantity reproduced by the material measure in order to ensure the compatibility of the results of its measurements.

Note 5 to entry: When possible and convenient, the uncertainty may be expressed in the relative form (see 3.3.3) or in the fiducial form (see 3.3.4). The relative uncertainty is the ratio U/V of the absolute uncertainty U to the measure value V, and the fiducial uncertainty is the ratio U/V of the absolute uncertainty U to a conventionally chosen value V.

### 3.7.2 Conventional Value

Measure-value of a standard used in a calibration operation and known with uncertainty negligible with respect to the uncertainty of the instrument to be calibrated.

Note 1 to entry: This definition is adapted to the object of this standard from the definition of "conventional true value (of a quantity)": value attributed to a particular quantity and accepted, sometimes by convention, as having an uncertainty appropriate for a given purpose.

[SOURCE: IEC 60359:2001, 3.1.13]

### 3.7.3 Intrinsic (Instrumental) Uncertainty

Uncertainty of a measuring instrument when used under reference conditions.

[SOURCE: IEC 60359:2001, 3.2.10]

### 3.7.4 Operating Instrumental Uncertainty

Instrumental uncertainty under the rated operating condition.

Note 1 to entry: The operating instrumental uncertainty, like the intrinsic one, is not evaluated by the user of the instrument, but is stated by its manufacturer or calibrator. The statement may be expressed by means of an algebraic relation involving the intrinsic instrumental uncertainty and the values of one or several influence quantities, but such a relation is just a convenient means of expressing a set of operating instrumental uncertainties under different operating conditions, not a functional relation to be used for evaluating the propagation of uncertainty inside the instrument.

[SOURCE: IEC 60359:2001, 3.2.11]

### 3.7.5 Limit of Uncertainty

Limiting value of the instrumental uncertainty for equipment operating under specified conditions.

Note 1 to entry: A limit of uncertainty may be assigned by the manufacturer of the instrument, who states that under the specified conditions the instrumental uncertainty is never higher than this limit, or may be defined by standards, that prescribe that under specified conditions the instrumental uncertainty should not be larger than this limit for the instrument to belong to a given accuracy class.

Note 2 to entry: A limit of uncertainty may be expressed in absolute terms or in the relative or fiducial forms.

The direction of deflection of the index of an instrument shall be from left to right or from bottom to top with increasing measured quantity. When the angular deflection of the index exceeds 180°, the deflection with increasing measured quantities should be clockwise. On multi-scale instruments, at least one of the scales shall comply with the above requirements.

## 5.6.4.4 Limits of the Measuring Range

### 5.6.4.4.1 Identifying Measuring Range Limits

If the measuring range does not occupy the whole scale length, the limits of the measuring range shall be clearly identified.

### 5.6.4.4.2 Minimal Ambiguity in Scale Marks

When the value of the scale divisions or the nature of the scale marks enables the measuring range to be identified with minimal ambiguity, no marking is necessary. An example of this method is given in Figure 1.

> **Figure 1** - Measuring range 10 A to 50 A  
> A diagram of a measuring range from 10 A to 50 A. The diagram is a semi-circle with values of scale divisions ranging from 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, to 60. The letter A is in the center of the semicircle.  
> **Note:** Subdivisions are omitted outside the measuring range.

### 5.6.4.4.3 Single Scale Marking

When there is only one scale and marking is necessary, the limits of the measuring range shall be identified by means of small filled-in dots. An example of this method is given in Figure 2.

> **Figure 2** - Measuring range 80 V to 110 V  
> A diagram of a measuring range from 80 V to 110 V. The diagram is a semi-circle with scale divisions ranging from 0, 50, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, to 150. The letter V is in the center of the semicircle. Dots appear above the semi-circle in positions 80, 110, and 120.  
> **Note:** The measuring range is indicated by the dots.

### 5.6.4.4.4 Multiple Scale Marking

When there is more than one scale and marking is necessary, the limits of the measuring range shall be identified either by small filled-in dots or by means of widened scale arcs. An example of this latter method is given in Figure 3.

> **Figure 3** - Scale with two measurement ranges for measuring resistance  
> The ranges are 0.06 MΩ to 0.4 MΩ and 0.1 MΩ to 2 MΩ. The scale reads in MΩ and has divisions from 0 to 8. There are also markings for IEC.

## 5.6.5 Stopper

The positions of the stopper of an instrument shall not coincide with that of upper and lower scale marks of the measuring range. The length of the stopper outside the scale shall be not less than 2% of the scale length.

## 5.6.6 Preferred Values

The preferred values shall be used in the absence of a special agreement between the manufacturer and the user. Requirements for preferred values are given in the relevant parts.

## 5.6.7 Adjusters, Mechanical and/or Electrical

### 5.6.7.1 Zero Adjuster(s)

When an instrument is fitted with zero adjuster(s), intended for use by the user, it is preferable that they be accessible from the front of the case. The total range of adjustment shall be not less than 2% of the scale length or 2°, whichever is the less, and the fineness of setting shall be appropriate to the class index of the instrument.

**Note:** By "appropriate", it is understood that the fineness of the setting is such as to permit seeing to within 1/5 of the class index.

For instruments where the effective center of rotation cannot readily be determined, the requirement relating to 2° is not applicable. The ratio between the higher and lower ranges of adjustment on either side of the zero mark shall not be greater than 2.

For the recommended test, see IEC 60051-9.

### 5.6.7.2 Span Adjuster(s)

When an instrument is fitted with span adjuster(s) intended for use by the user, it is preferable that they be accessible from the front of the case. The total range of adjustment shall be not less than 2% of the scale length or 2°, whichever is the less, and the fineness of setting shall be appropriate to the class index of the instrument.

**Note:** By "appropriate," it is understood that the fineness of the setting is such as to permit setting to within 1/5 of the class index.

For instruments where the effective center of rotation cannot readily be determined, the requirement relating to 2° is not applicable. The ratio between the higher and lower ranges of adjustment on either side of the zero mark shall not be greater than 2. For the recommended test, see IEC 60051-9.

### 5.6.8 Effects of Vibration and Shock

#### 5.6.8.1 Vibration Test

Unless otherwise specified, instruments and accessories of class indices 1 and greater shall be capable of withstanding the vibration test specified in IEC 60051-9.

### 6.2.6

By agreement between the manufacturer and the user, any or all of the information may be omitted.

### 6.3 Markings Relating to the Reference Values and Nominal Ranges of Use of Influence Quantities

#### 6.3.1

Where a reference value or a reference range is different from that given in Table 2, it shall be marked and shall be distinguished by being underlined. It is identified by the symbol of the unit in which it is measured.

#### 6.3.2

When a nominal range of use is different from that given in Table 3, it shall be marked. The marking is carried out in conjunction with marking the reference value or reference range. This then requires the marking of the reference value or reference range even if it would not otherwise be necessary.

#### 6.3.3

The marking is done by writing the limits of the nominal range of use and the reference value (or range) in ascending order, each number separated from its neighbor by three dots.

**Example 1:** 35 Hz ... 50 Hz ... 60 Hz implies a reference frequency of 50 Hz and a nominal range of use for frequency from 35 Hz to 60 Hz.

**Example 2:** 35 Hz ... 45 Hz ... 55 Hz ... 60 Hz implies a reference frequency range from 45 Hz to 55 Hz and a nominal range of use for frequency from 35 Hz to 60 Hz.

#### 6.3.4

When any limit of the nominal range of use is the same as the reference value or the adjacent limit of the reference range, the number indicating the reference value or the limit of the reference range shall be repeated for the limit of the nominal range of use.

**Example 1:** 23 °C ... 23 °C ... 37 °C implies a reference temperature of 23 °C and a nominal range of use for temperature from 23 °C to 37 °C.

**Example 2:** 20 °C ... 20 °C ... 25 °C ... 35 °C implies a reference temperature range from 20 °C to 25 °C and a nominal range of use for temperature from 20 °C to 35 °C.

### 8.6 Judgement of Test Results

During the test, if the weight of nonconformity class A or other class translating to A of any specimen is accumulatively no less than 1, the specimen is a nonconforming item. Unless otherwise stated, the nonconformity which repeats on the same test of the same specimen is considered as one.

## Annex A (Normative)

### Limits of Intrinsic Uncertainty and Variations

A.1 When an instrument or an accessory is operated under reference conditions, it is permitted to have an uncertainty (the intrinsic uncertainty) no greater than that implied by its class index. For example, for a class 0.5 instrument, the intrinsic uncertainties are not permitted to exceed 0.5% of the fiducial value.

# Instrument Uncertainty and Temperature Influence

## A.2 Variation in Uncertainty

When an instrument or accessory is operated outside its reference conditions for a particular influence quantity (but under reference conditions for all other influence quantities), it is permitted to have a change in its uncertainty, called a variation, when that influence quantity is changed up to the limit of its nominal range of use. The value of the permissible variation is expressed as a percentage (usually 100%) of the permissible intrinsic uncertainty.

## A.3 Consistent Variation Across Nominal Range

The same value of variation is permitted over the whole of the nominal range of use up to both of its limits, but the sign need not be the same.

## A.4 Example of Temperature Influence

For example, an instrument having a class index of 0.5 and a reference temperature of 40 °C, marked as 40 °C in accordance with 6.3.1, is permitted to have an intrinsic uncertainty of ±100% of the class index, at the reference temperature and over the testing tolerance of ±2 °C (see Table 2) around 40 °C.

## A.5 Variation Over Nominal Temperature Range

In addition, over the nominal range of use for temperature of 30 °C to 50 °C (reference temperature is 40 °C), this instrument is permitted to have a variation of ±100% of the class index around the value of the uncertainty which it had at the reference temperature (40 °C). It is thus possible for the instrument to have a smaller uncertainty at some temperature within the nominal range of use than it had at the reference temperature.

> **Figure A.1**  
> This figure shows a graph of Uncertainty vs Temperature. The y-axis is labeled as 'Uncertainty' and shows values +2c, +c, 0, -c, -2c from top to bottom. The x-axis is labeled 'Temperature °C' and shows values 30, 38, 40, 42, 50 from left to right. The uncertainty/temperature curve of the instrument and its relation to the class index c are also shown.

**NOTE 1:** Reference value: 40 °C.  
**NOTE 2:** Nominal range of use (Table 3): 30 °C to 50 °C.

## A.6 Effect of Temperature

Figure A.1 shows how the uncertainty of this instrument is permitted to alter with temperature, the class index being shown as c.

## A.7 Uncertainty Across Temperature Ranges

If the uncertainty at the reference temperature (the intrinsic uncertainty) had been at its maximum permitted value of +c, the total permitted uncertainty over the temperature ranges 30 °C to 38 °C and 42 °C to 50 °C would have been between zero and +2c. Similarly, if the intrinsic uncertainty had been -c, the total permitted uncertainty would have been from zero to -2c.

## A.8 Reference Range and Nominal Range

When the reference condition of a particular influence quantity is a reference range, over the parts of the nominal range of use which are outside the reference range, the permissible variation is centered on the value of the uncertainty at the adjacent limit of the reference range.

## A.9 Temperature Influence Quantities

For temperature influence quantity of group A and group B, the variation due to influence quantities changes from the reference temperature to the upper and lower of the nominal temperature range. For temperature influence quantity of group C, the variation is a temperature coefficient. The permissible variation of an instrument or an accessory caused by the temperature influence quantity changed per 10K from the reference temperature (the reference temperature range) is the value of ±50% of the class index, in nominal temperature range.

## A.10 Example of Class Index and Temperature Range

Figure A.2 is an example of an instrument having a class index of 0.5 and marked –30 °C ... +10 °C ... +30 °C ... +50 °C in accordance with 6.3.4 (reference range for temperature +10 °C to +30 °C; nominal range of use for temperature -30 °C to +50 °C) is permitted to have an intrinsic uncertainty of ±100% of the class index over the temperature range +10 °C to +30 °C.

**Figure A.2 – Effect of Temperature**

A.11 In addition, over the nominal range of use of -30 °C to +10 °C, a variation is permitted of ±100% of the class index centered on the uncertainty which the instrument had at +10 °C. Similarly, a variation of ±100% of the class index, centered on the uncertainty which the instrument had at +30 °C, is permitted over the nominal range of use from +30 °C to +50 °C.

A.12 If, as is likely in practice, more than one influence quantity is simultaneously outside its reference condition, the resultant uncertainty is unlikely to exceed the sum of the separate variations and may be smaller than any of them, as the resulting uncertainties may to some extent cancel each other.

A.13 Information about the simultaneous effect of several influence quantities can usually only be determined by carrying out tests for particular combinations of values of influence quantities. The manufacturer may sometimes be able to provide this information.

A.14 Manufacturers usually may not be able to provide the information about the simultaneous effect of several or all influence quantities. Users can evaluate the maximum permitted operating uncertainty using the formula given in Annex C.

The x-axis represents relative humidity in percentage, ranging from 0 to 100. Three curves on the graph represent different conditions: "Limits for each of 30 days spread in a natural manner over one year" (dashed line), "Limits occasionally reached on other days" (dotted line), and "Annual mean" (solid line). An area in the upper right corner of the graph is labeled "Climatic conditions that do not occur in practice," while a smaller area near the bottom right corner is labeled "Climatic conditions that do occur in practice."

## Annex C (informative)

### Estimation of Uncertainties

C.1 Uncertainties in this Standard

Uncertainties described in this part of IEC 60051 are shown in Figure C.1.

# Operating Uncertainty

## C.2 Operating Uncertainty

### C.2.1 General

Operating uncertainty shall include intrinsic uncertainty (under reference conditions) and the variations due to influence quantities. Users have two ways to estimate the maximum operating uncertainty of an instrument in use. One way is to estimate according to type test data provided by the manufacturer; the other way is to estimate according to the limit of intrinsic uncertainty and the limit of variations due to every influence specified by this standard relating to their class index.

### C.2.2 Estimating Absolute Operating Uncertainty According to Type Test Results

Operating uncertainty shall include intrinsic uncertainty (under reference conditions) and the variations due to influence quantities. When manufacturers provide type test data, absolute operating uncertainty can be estimated using Formula C.1. Intrinsic uncertainty has a dependency with each influence quantity; the variations obtained from type tests can be treated as a rectangular distribution, and the influence quantities are mutually independent. The operating uncertainty is expanded uncertainty, which has a coverage factor of 2 (corresponding to a coverage probability of approximately 95%), then:

\[ U_{op} = U_{int} + 2\sqrt{\frac{V_1^2}{\sqrt{3}^2} + \frac{V_2^2}{\sqrt{3}^2} + \ldots + \frac{V_n^2}{\sqrt{3}^2}} \]

\[ U_{op} = U_{int} + 1.15\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n V_i^2} \]

(C.1)

Where:
- \( U_{op} \) is the absolute operating uncertainty;
- \( U_{int} \) is the absolute intrinsic uncertainty;
- \( V_i \) are the variations due to every influence (in the rated operating range), which are determined in the test;
- \( i \) is the number of variations;
- \( n \) is the quantity of variations.

### C.2.3 Estimating Absolute Operating Uncertainty According to Limit of Intrinsic Uncertainty and Limit of Variations Due to Every Influence Specified by This Standard

Without a manufacturer's type test data, absolute operating uncertainty can be estimated according to the limit of intrinsic uncertainty and the limit of variations due to every influence specified by this part of IEC 60051 relating to the class index, using Formula C.2.

Intrinsic uncertainty is related to influence quantities, and influence quantities are mutually independent. The limits of variations specified by this part of IEC 60051 can be treated as a Gaussian distribution. Operating uncertainty is expanded uncertainty, which has a coverage factor of 2 (corresponding to a coverage probability of approximately 95%). The limits of variations specified by this standard have a coverage factor of 2, so half of the variation limit is considered as the standard uncertainty. Then:

\[ U_{op} = U_{int} + 2\sqrt{\frac{V_1^2}{2^2} + \frac{V_2^2}{2^2} + \ldots + \frac{V_n^2}{2^2}} \]

\[ U_{op} = U_{int} + \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n V_i^2} \]

(C.2)

Where:
- \( U_{op} \) is the absolute operating uncertainty obtained from this standard;
- \( U_{int} \) is the absolute intrinsic uncertainty specified by this standard;
- \( V_i \) are the variations due to every influence (in the rated operating range), which are specified in Table 3 and related parts of this standard;
- \( i \) is the number of variations;
- \( n \) is the quantity of variations.

# SAUDI STANDARD SASO IEC 60051-1: 2020

## C.3 Overall System Uncertainty

The overall system uncertainty of an instrument with external accessory(ies) such as shunt, resistor, and impedance shall include the operating uncertainty of the instrument, the uncertainty of the impedance of wires, and the operating uncertainty of accessory(ies).

Formula (C.3) is a simplified approach and applies only to voltage, current, active power, reactive power, power factor, and phase measurements:

\[ U_s = 1.15 \sqrt{U_{op}^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{N}(U_a + U_w)^2} \]

Where:

- \( U_s \) is the overall system uncertainty;
- \( U_{op} \) is the absolute operating uncertainty of an instrument;
- \( U_a \) is the absolute operating uncertainty of interchangeable accessory;
- \( U_w \) is the absolute uncertainty of impedance of wires;
- \( N \) is the quantity of accessories;
- \( i \) is the number of transducers or wires.

## C.4 Fiducial Operating Uncertainty

According to 3.7.1, Note 5, the fiducial uncertainty is the ratio \( U/V_f \) of the absolute uncertainty \( U \) to a conventionally chosen value \( V_f \). So, the fiducial operating uncertainty expressed in percentage shall be determined using Formula C.4:

\[ U_F = \frac{U_{abs}}{F} \times 100\% \]

Where:

- \( U_F \) is the fiducial operating uncertainty;
- \( U_{abs} \) is the absolute operating uncertainty;
- \( F \) is the fiducial value.

---

## Annex D (Normative)

### Routine Tests

General routine tests shall be carried out on all products according to the specified items below:

- Test for intrinsic uncertainty (subclause 5.2);
- Test for variation due to position (subclause 5.3; Table 3);
- The voltage test shall be performed on all the instruments and accessories which have both hazardous live parts and accessible conductive parts (subclause 5.5.1).

NOTE: Measuring terminals of rack-mounted and panel-mounted meters under normal operating conditions are not considered as accessible parts.

- Test for return to zero (subclause 5.5.5)
- Other tests supplemented in relevant parts
