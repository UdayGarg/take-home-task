## NFPA® 86

### Standard for Ovens and Furnaces

**2015 Edition**

This edition of NFPA 86, *Standard for Ovens and Furnaces*, was prepared by the Technical Committee on Ovens and Furnaces. It was issued by the Standards Council on April 29, 2014, with an effective date of May 19, 2014, and supersedes all previous editions.

This edition of NFPA 86 was approved as an American National Standard on May 19, 2014.

### Origin and Development of NFPA 86

The history of the NFPA standards for ovens and furnaces goes back to NBFU 34, *Regulations of the Board of Fire Underwriters for Finishing Processes (other than paint spraying) Dip Tanks, Hardening and Tempering Tanks, Flow Coat Work, Japanning and Enameling Including Ovens as Recommended by the National Fire Protection Association*, which was issued in 1926. Subsequently, the ovens part of NBFU 34 was separated and issued as NBFU 86, *Regulations of the National Board of Fire Underwriters for Ovens For Japan, Enamel, and Other Flammable Finishes as Recommended by the National Fire Protection Association*, in 1931. In 1948, NBFU 86 became NFPA 86-T, *Tentative Standards for Class A Oven Design, Location and Equipment*. The document was issued as a standard in 1950 and titled NFPA 86, *Standards for Class A Ovens and Furnace Design, Location and Equipment*.

The 1985 edition of NFPA 86 was the first edition of the standard in its current form. It was created from the combination of the former NFPA 86A, *Standard for Ovens and Furnaces — Design, Location and Equipment*, and NFPA 86B, *Standard for Industrial Furnaces — Design, Location and Equipment*.

# NFPA 86: Ovens and Furnaces

The committee introduced changes in the definitions of Class A and Class B ovens, which were published in the 1982 edition of NFPA 86B and added as a tentative interim amendment in 1983 to the 1977 edition of NFPA 86A. The changes in the definitions eliminated the principal differences between the two standards, except for the ventilation requirements contained in NFPA 86A. By providing a separate chapter for ventilation requirements in the 1985 edition (Chapter 5), the Committee found it was no longer necessary or desirable to maintain two separate documents that addressed the same subjects.

The changes that were incorporated into the 1985 edition included the following:

1. A new chapter dealing with low-oxygen atmosphere ovens was added.
2. The definitions of subjects contained in the text were updated and new definitions provided.
3. The text was refined in an effort to make the document more understandable.
4. The material was rearranged to comply with the *NFPA Manual of Style*.

The 1995 edition of NFPA 86 correlated with NFPA 86C, *Standard for Industrial Furnaces Using a Special Processing Atmosphere*, and NFPA 86D, *Standard for Industrial Furnaces Using Vacuum as an Atmosphere*. It also refined and updated the standard to more current technologies, provided increased requirements in several areas, and expanded the explanatory material in the appendixes.

The 1999 edition of NFPA 86 included changes to the technical requirements in several areas and many refinements that clarified the technical requirements. Changes were also provided to more clearly distinguish mandatory requirements from nonmandatory recommendations and explanatory material. Nonmandatory notes were relocated to the appendixes.

The 2003 edition of NFPA 86 was a complete revision that incorporated NFPA 86C, *Standard for Industrial Furnaces Using a Special Processing Atmosphere*, and NFPA 86D, *Standard for Industrial Furnaces Using Vacuum as an Atmosphere*. This new, combined document provided one standard for ovens and furnaces of all types. Also, in accordance with the *Manual of Style for NFPA Technical Committee Documents*, referenced publications were listed in Chapter 2 and all definitions moved to Chapter 3.

The 2007 edition of NFPA 86 continued to bring the standard into compliance with the *Manual of Style for NFPA Technical Committee Documents* and to update requirements. Requirements for logic systems and programmable logic controller-based systems replaced the requirement that programmable logic controllers be specifically listed for combustion safety service, since listed controllers were no longer available. Unenforceable text was revised to be enforceable, deleted, or relocated to Annex A. Where appropriate, repetitive text was replaced by tables. The former Chapter 14, Inspection, Testing and Maintenance, was renumbered and renamed as Chapter 7, Commissioning, Operations, Maintenance, Inspection, and Testing. Requirements for operations and maintenance throughout the standard were then relocated to that chapter.

In the 2011 edition, the scope of NFPA 86 was clarified to exclude fluid heaters, and reference was made to the new NFPA 87, *Recommended Practice for Fluid Heaters*. All requirements for fire protection were relocated to Chapter 9. Chapter 13, which covers Class C furnaces, was revised to clarify the requirements for the introduction and removal of special atmospheres. The requirements for repeated pre-ignition purge were revised to recognize the unique characteristics of ovens utilizing pulse firing of burners. In addition, the requirements for safety shutoff valves that must close when a burner experiences a loss of flame signal were clarified.

The 2015 edition of NFPA 86 includes several changes to Chapter 3 due to the addition of definitions for *burner management system, flame failure response time, flame detector, hardwired, combustion safeguard*, and *pressure regulator* types. The Committee also deleted requirements from Chapter 12 applicable to arc melting furnaces (or electric arc furnaces) as the provisions have not been maintained and the Committee no longer has the relevant expertise. The Committee added procedures for placing equipment into service based on purging practices in NFPA 54 and NFPA 56. The Committee modified the standard to clarify the types of acceptable devices used for combustion safety service. The Committee added a requirement prohibiting manifolding vent lines from different pressure levels. As a result of introducing definitions for *burner management system* and *combustion safeguard*, the Committee modified requirements in Chapter 8 for logic systems for both BMS logic and programmable logic controller (PLC) systems. The Committee modified requirements for Class A and Class C ovens and furnaces, including the development of new requirements on fire protection and safety ventilation for Class A ovens.

### 11.6.8.4 Methods for Determining Solvent Safety Ventilation Rate

#### (A) Method A

1. **Determine Vapor Volume per Solvent Amount**:  
   Use one of the following equations:

   \[ \frac{\text{ft³ vapor}}{\text{gal solvent}} = \left( \frac{8.328}{0.075} \right) \left( \frac{SpGr}{VD} \right) \]

   \[ \frac{\text{m³ vapor}}{\text{L solvent}} = \left( \frac{0.998}{1.200} \right) \left( \frac{SpGr}{VD} \right) \]

   where:  
   1 gal water = 8.328 lb at 70°F  
   Dry air at 70°F = 0.075 lb/ft³ and 29.9 in. Hg  
   $SpGr$ = specific gravity of solvent (water = 1.0)  
   $VD$ = vapor density of solvent vapor (air = 1.0)  
   1 L water = 0.998 kg at 21°C  
   Dry air at 21°C = 1200 kg/m³ and 0.76 m Hg

2. **Determine Volume of Barely Explosive Mixture per Solvent Amount**:  
   Use one of the following equations:

   \[ \frac{\text{ft³ barely explosive mixture}}{\text{gal solvent}} = \left( \frac{\text{ft³}}{\text{gal solvent}} \right) \left( \frac{100}{LFL_T} \right) \]

# Solvent Safety Ventilation and Flammability Calculations

## Equations for Vapor and Mixture Calculations

### Method A

To determine the volume of barely explosive vapor per liter of solvent, use the following equation:

\[ 
\frac{\text{m³ barely explosive vapor}}{\text{L solvent}} = \left( \frac{\text{m³}}{\text{L solvent}} \right) \left( \frac{100}{LFL_T} \right) 
\]

where:

- **\(LFL_T\)**: Lower flammable limit (percentage by volume in air), corrected for temperature.

To determine the volume of diluted mixture at 25 percent LFL per amount (gallon or liter) of solvent evaporated in the process, use one of the following equations:

\[ 
\frac{\text{ft³ diluted mixture @ 25\% LFL}}{\text{gal solvent evaporated}} = 4 \left( \frac{\text{ft³ barely explosive mixture}}{\text{gal solvent evaporated}} \right) 
\]

\[ 
\frac{\text{m³ diluted mixture @ 25\% LFL}}{\text{L solvent evaporated}} = 4 \left( \frac{\text{m³ barely explosive mixture}}{\text{L solvent evaporated}} \right) 
\]

### Method B

Method B shall be calculated by determining the volume of vapor per amount of solvent using one of the following equations:

\[ 
\frac{\text{ft³ diluted mixture @ 25\% LFL}}{\text{gal solvent evaporated}} = 4 \left( \frac{8.329}{0.075} \right) \left( \frac{SpGr}{VD} \right) \left( \frac{100}{LFL_T} \right) 
\]

\[ 
\frac{\text{m³ diluted mixture @ 25\% LFL}}{\text{L solvent evaporated}} = 4 \left( \frac{0.998}{1.200} \right) \left( \frac{SpGr}{VD} \right) \left( \frac{100}{LFL_T} \right) 
\]

## Estimating Solvent Safety Ventilation Rate

### Continuous Process Ovens

1. The elevation is below 1000 ft (305 m).
2. The oven operating temperature is at or below 350°F (177°C).
3. The volume of air that dilutes the vapor from 1 gallon of solvent to the lower flammable limit (LFL) rendered barely flammable for the solvent used is less than 2640 scf/gal (19.75 standard m³/L).
4. The rate of safety ventilation is corrected for the temperature of the exhaust stream exiting the oven.

### Required Minimum Rate of Exhaust Air Flow

The required minimum rate of exhaust air flow, at standard atmosphere and temperature, shall be determined by multiplying the cubic feet of diluted mixture at 25 percent LFL per gallon of solvent evaporated in the process by the maximum allowable gallons per minute of solvent entering the process oven, as follows:

\[ 
\text{ft³ or m³ of exhaust to prove safety ventilation} = \left( \frac{\text{gal or L of solvent entering the oven}}{\text{min}} \right) \left( \frac{\text{ft³ or m³ diluted mixture @ 25\% LFL}}{\text{gal or L of solvent evaporated}} \right) 
\]

## Corrections for Temperature and Altitude

The safety ventilation value determined in 11.6.8.4 shall be corrected for the exhaust stream temperature and altitude to determine the actual flow, as follows:

1. Apply the temperature correction factor from 11.6.5.1.

2. **Alternative Ventilation Rate:**  
   Where ventilation is provided with exhaust fans and other devices to prevent the average concentration in the oven from exceeding 25 percent of the LFL.

3. **Continuous Vapor Concentration High Limit Controller:**  
   - **Alarm and Shutdown:** The controller is arranged to alarm and shut down the oven heating system.
   - **Additional Exhaust Fans:** The controller operates additional exhaust fans at a predetermined vapor concentration not exceeding 50 percent of the LFL. The amount of ventilation air in standard cubic feet (standard cubic meters) that is rendered barely flammable by the vapor generated in gallons per hour (liters per hour) of solvent in use is determined. This value is then multiplied by an empirical factor of 10 and divided by 60 minutes/hour to obtain the safety ventilation in standard cubic feet per minute (standard cubic meters per minute).

### B. Method for Estimating Rate of Ventilation

Batch ovens shall have a minimum safety ventilation rate either as given above or as follows:

1. **Design and Maintenance:**  
   The safety ventilation rate of batch ovens shall be designed and maintained to provide 440 scfm of air per gallon (3.29 standard m³/min of air per L) of flammable volatiles in each batch.

2. **Adjustment for Solvent Requirements:**  
   Where the solvent used requires a volume of air greater than 2640 standard ft³ to dilute vapor from 1 gallon of solvent to the LFL (19.75 standard m³/L), safety ventilation shall be adjusted in proportion to the ratio of the actual volume of air necessary to render 2640 ft³/gal (19.75 m³/L) barely explosive.

**CAUTION:** Caution shall be used when applying this method to products of low mass that can heat up quickly (such as paper or textiles) or materials coated with very highly volatile solvents. Either condition can produce too high a peak evaporation rate for this method to be used.

## Correction Factors

Correction factors shall be applied as follows:

1. **Temperature Correction Factor:**  
   Determined in 11.6.5.1, applied to adjust for the impact of temperature on exhaust efficiency.

## A.1.1 Explosions and Fires

Explosions and fires in fuel-fired and electric heat utilization equipment constitute a loss potential in life, property, and production. This standard is a compilation of guidelines, rules, and methods applicable to the safe operation of this type of equipment.

Conditions and regulations that are not covered in this standard, such as toxic vapors, hazardous materials, noise levels, heat stress, and local, state, and federal regulations (EPA and OSHA), should be considered in the design and operation of furnaces.

Most failures can be traced to human error. The most significant failures include inadequate training of operators, lack of proper maintenance, and improper application of equipment. Users and designers must utilize engineering skill to bring together the proper combination of controls and training necessary for the safe operation of equipment. This standard classifies furnaces as follows:

# Ovens and Furnaces Classification

## Class A Ovens and Furnaces

Class **A ovens and furnaces** are heat utilization equipment operating at approximately atmospheric pressure wherein there is a potential explosion or fire hazard that could be occasioned by the presence of flammable volatiles or combustible materials processed or heated in the furnace. Such flammable volatiles or combustible materials can originate from any of the following:

- Paints, powders, inks, and adhesives from finishing processes, such as dipped, coated, sprayed, and impregnated materials
- Substrate material
- Wood, paper, and plastic pallets, spacers, or packaging materials
- Polymerization or other molecular rearrangements

Potentially flammable materials, such as quench oil, waterborne finishes, cooling oil, and cooking oils, that present a hazard are ventilated according to Class A standards.

## Class B Ovens and Furnaces

Class **B ovens and furnaces** are heat utilization equipment operating at approximately atmospheric pressure wherein no flammable volatiles or combustible materials are being heated.

## Class C Ovens and Furnaces

Class **C ovens and furnaces** are those in which there is a potential hazard due to a flammable or other special atmosphere being used for treatment of material in process. This type of furnace can use any type of heating system and includes a special atmosphere supply system(s). Also included in the Class C classification are integral quench furnaces and molten salt bath furnaces.

## Class D Furnaces

Class **D furnaces** are vacuum furnaces that operate at temperatures that exceed ambient to over 5000°F (2760°C) and at pressures from vacuum to several atmospheres during heating using any type of heating system. These furnaces can include the use of special processing atmospheres. During gas quenching, these furnaces can operate at pressures from below atmospheric to over a gauge pressure of 100 psi (690 kPa).

## Vacuum Furnaces

Vacuum furnaces generally are described as cold-wall furnaces, hot-wall furnaces, or furnaces used for casting or melting of metal at high temperatures up to 5000°F (2760°C). There can be other special types.

# Furnace Types and Melting Processes

For more detailed information on the various types of furnaces, see Table A.1.1.6. See Figure A.1.1.6(a) through Figure A.1.1.6(c) for examples of a cold-wall, horizontal, front-loading vacuum furnace; a cold-wall, induction-heated vacuum furnace; and a hot-wall, single-pumped, retort vacuum furnace.

## Plasma Melting

Plasma melting is a process by which metal solids, powders, chips, and fines are consolidated into ingot or slab form. Melting is accomplished by the use of an ionized gas that transfers heat from the plasma torch to the material. The gas might be oxidizing, reducing, or inert, depending on the process requirements. The temperature of the plasma gas is in excess of 3632°F (2000°C). Material consolidation might be in the form of an ingot, usually extracted from the bottom of the melt chamber, or a slab that is removed horizontally from the melt chamber.

The melt chamber operating pressure might vary from 10^-2 atmospheres to 2 atmospheres, making the process suitable for a wide variety of metals and alloys. Cleaning and refinement of the material might be accomplished by the use of hearth melting, stirring action by torch manipulation, inductive stirring coils, or vacuum/pressure cycling of the melt chamber.

The melt chamber, torches, copper hearths, consolidation containment system, and power supplies are water-cooled. Each water-cooled circuit is monitored for low flow and high temperature, with alarms for all circuits, power disruption for critical circuits, or both.

Solid-state power supplies are utilized to provide power to the torches, which range in size from 47 Btu/hr (50 kW) for a small research unit to multiple torches of 948 Btu/hr (1000 kW) each for large production melters. The torches provide x, y, and z movements that are programmable or computer-controlled. *See Figure A.1.1.6(d).*

## Electron-Beam (EB) Melting

Of all commercial melting techniques, electron-beam (EB) melting is capable of producing the highest refinement of the end product. The beam of the electron gun can be focused to produce heat intense enough to vaporize even those metals with the highest melting points. When combined with a vacuum atmosphere of approximately 10^-4 torr (1.3 × 10^-6 Pa), most impurities can be separated from the product being melted. EB melting is especially suited for refining refractory metals and highly reactive metals, but it also has applications in melting alloy steels.

Commercial EB melters are available in a variety of sizes and configurations. Figure A.1.1.6(e) illustrates a vertical feed system that allows the molten metal to drop from the feedstock into a water-cooled copper retention hearth, where the molten metal is further refined by the oscillating beams of the two guns. The retention time of the metal in the hearth is controlled by adjusting the melt rate of the feedstock. The metal flows over a weir at the end of the hearth and falls into a water-cooled chill ring, where it solidifies into a billet as it is withdrawn downward from the chamber. Vaporized impurities condense on the cold inner walls of the vacuum chamber or on special collector plates that are easily removed for cleaning. Because of the intense heat needed for the melting and refining process, the vacuum chamber is usually of double-wall construction so that large quantities of cooling water can circulate through the passages of the chamber.

# Vacuum Arc Melting and Vacuum Arc Skull Casting

Vacuum arc melting is a high-volume production method for alloying and refining metals. Alloys can be produced by sandwiching and welding strips of different metals together to produce an electrode that, after melting, results in the desired alloy. Second and third melts are sometimes necessary to refine the alloy. Most arc melters are of the consumable electrode type; however, nonconsumable electrode melters are commercially available. Figure A.1.1.6(f) illustrates the principal components of one type of consumable electrode arc melter.

In operation, a dc voltage potential is established between the stinger rod, which has the electrode attached to it, and the water-cooled copper melt cup. The stinger rod is driven down until an arc is established between the electrode and a metal disk placed in the bottom of the melt cup. Once the arc has stabilized and melting begins, the voltage might be reduced, thus shortening the arc length and lessening the possibility of arcing to the water-cooled sidewall of the cup.

Automatic control systems are available for controlling the arc length and melt rates. A mechanical booster pumping system provides vacuum operating levels of approximately 102 torr (1.3 × 10^-4 Pa). Water-cooling circuits are provided for the stinger rod, head, melt cup, solid-state power supply, cables and connections, and vacuum pumping system.

## 86-62 Ovens and Furnaces

The vacuum arc skull caster is a variation of the vacuum arc melter, with the essential difference that, instead of melting the electrode into a copper cup and allowing the molten metal to solidify, the electrode is melted into a cold-wall copper crucible. The crucible is then tilted, allowing the molten metal to pour into a casting mold, leaving a solidified metal lining, or "skull," in the crucible.

Burn-throughs into water jackets, which allow water to come in contact with hot metal, are not uncommon in arc melting. Equipment damage can be minimized by providing overpressure-relief ports, reliable cooling water sources, well-designed and monitored cooling circuits, and well-trained operators. Blast protection walls are frequently installed for personnel protection.

### A.1.1.7(1) Designing Coal or Other Solid Fuel-Firing Systems

Designing coal or other solid fuel-firing systems requires special knowledge and experience with such solid fuel systems. Different types of coal (e.g., anthracite vs. sub-bituminous) and other solid fuels such as petroleum coke, wood chips, sawdust, other biomass, and combustible dusts like medium density fiberboard dust can introduce significantly different hazards and require significantly different handling systems and fuel delivery systems.

Solid fuels present unique burner control challenges. For example, there might be challenges in selecting and arranging flame supervision devices, selecting the method of fuel preparation and delivery, and determining actions to take in an emergency shutdown.

The best guidance from NFPA for coal-fired systems (pulverized or aggregate) is NFPA 85, *Boiler and Combustion Systems Hazards Code*. Another resource is FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheet 6-17, "Rotary Kilns and Dryers." Burning of other solid fuels is less standardized. An available resource is FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheet 6-13, "Waste Fuel Fired Boilers."

Coordinating this guidance into the design of an oven or furnace requires special knowledge and experience so that the solid fuel system is integrated into the overall oven or furnace system while maintaining the intent of NFPA 86 with regard to other interlock and control requirements.

## 86-64 Ovens and Furnaces

### A.1.5

No standard can guarantee the elimination of furnace fires and explosions. Technology in this area is under constant development, which is reflected in fuel, special processing atmospheres, flammable vapors, and quench systems, with regard to the type of equipment and the characteristics of the various fluids. Therefore, the designer is cautioned that this standard is not a design handbook and thus does not eliminate the need for an engineer or competent engineering judgment. It is the intention of this standard that a designer capable of applying more complete and rigorous analysis to special or unusual problems have latitude in the development of furnace designs. In such cases, the designer should be responsible for demonstrating and documenting the safety and validity of the design.

### A.3.2.1 Approved

The National Fire Protection Association does not approve, inspect, or certify any installations, procedures, equipment, or materials; nor does it approve or evaluate testing laboratories. In determining the acceptability of installations, procedures, equipment, or materials, the authority having jurisdiction may base acceptance on compliance with NFPA or other appropriate standards. In the absence of such standards, said authority may require evidence of proper installation, procedure, or use. The authority having jurisdiction may also refer to the listings or labeling practices of an organization that is concerned with product evaluations and is thus in a position to determine compliance with appropriate standards for the current production of listed items.

### A.3.2.2 Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)

The phrase "authority having jurisdiction," or its acronym AHJ, is used in NFPA documents in a broad manner, since jurisdictions and approval agencies vary, as do their responsibilities. Where public safety is primary, the authority having jurisdiction may be a federal, state, local, or other regional department or individual such as a fire chief; fire marshal; chief of a fire prevention bureau, labor department, or health department; building official; electrical inspector; or others having statutory authority. For insurance purposes, an insurance inspection department, rating bureau, or other insurance company representative may be the authority having jurisdiction. In many circumstances, the property owner or his or her designated agent assumes the role of the authority having jurisdiction; at government installations, the commanding officer or departmental official may be the authority having jurisdiction.

### A.3.2.4 Listed

The means for identifying listed equipment may vary for each organization concerned with product evaluation; some organizations do not recognize equipment as listed unless it is also labeled. The authority having jurisdiction should utilize the system employed by the listing organization to identify a listed product.

### A.3.3.6 Burner Management System

The burner management system logic can include the following functions: safety interlocks, pre-purge, trial for ignition, and safe-start check.

# Annex A

## A.3.3.13 Cryogenic Fluid

In the context of this standard, cryogenic fluid generally refers to gases made at low temperatures and stored at the user site in an insulated tank for use as an inert purge gas or as an atmosphere or atmosphere constituent (e.g., nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, oxygen). Cryogenic fluids must be stored and piped in vessels and piping that conform to the requirements for low-temperature fluids in the applicable NFPA, CGA, ANSI, and ASME standards.

## A.3.3.14 Cut-Away Damper

Cut-away dampers normally are placed in the exhaust or fresh air intake ducts to ensure that the required minimum amount of exhaust or fresh air is handled by the ventilating fans.

## A.3.3.16 Explosion-Resistant (Radiant Tube)

The radiant tube or the radiant tube heat recovery system can experience bulging and distortion but should not fail catastrophically.

## A.3.3.20 Flame Propagation Rate

This rate is a function of the temperature and the mixture conditions existing in the combustion space, burner, or piping under consideration.

## A.3.3.21 Flame Rod

The resulting electrical current, which passes through the flame, is rectified, and this rectified current is amplified by the flame detector.

## A.3.3.22 Flammable Limits

LFL is also known as lower explosive limit (LEL). See ASTM E 681, Standard Test Method for Concentration Limits of Flammability of Chemicals (Vapors and Gases).

## A.3.3.27.3 Class A Furnace

Flammable volatiles or combustible materials can include, but are not limited to, any of the following:

- Paints, powders, inks, and adhesives from finishing processes, such as dipped, coated, sprayed, and impregnated materials
- Substrate material
- Wood, paper, and plastic pallets, spacers, or packaging materials
- Polymerization or other molecular rearrangements

In addition, potentially flammable materials, such as quench oil, waterborne finishes, cooling oil, or cooking oils, that present a hazard should be ventilated according to Class A standards.

## A.3.3.27.4 Class B Furnace

It is important to note that the loads processed in Class B furnaces typically do not contain any flammable volatiles or combustible materials. However, when small amounts of flammable volatiles or combustible materials are present, it can be appropriate not to add safety ventilation, as would be required for a Class A furnace, when doing so would be detrimental to the process and would not increase the level of safety. (See A.3.3.25.3.)

## A.3.3.27.5 Class C Furnace

This type of furnace uses any type of heating system and includes a special atmosphere supply system(s). Also included in the Class C classification are integral quench furnaces and molten salt bath furnaces.

## A.3.3.27.6 Class D Furnace

During inert gas quenching, Class D furnaces operate at pressures from below atmospheric to over a gauge pressure of 100 psi (690 kPa).

## A.3.3.30 Gas Quenching

The gas is recirculated over the work and through a heat exchanger by means of a fan or blower.

## A.3.3.32 Hardwired

When the term hardwired is applied to the logic system itself, it refers to the method of using individual devices and interconnecting wiring to program and perform the logic functions without the use of software-based logic solvers.

## A.3.3.33.1 Dielectric Heating System

This type of heater is useful for heating materials that commonly are thought to be nonconductive. Examples of uses include heating plastic preforms before molding, curing glue in plywood, drying rayon cakes, and other similar applications.

## A.3.3.33.3 Direct-Fired Heating System

The following are different types of direct-fired heating systems:

# Heating Systems

## Types of Direct-Fired Heaters

1. **Direct-Fired, External, Nonrecirculating Heater**  
   A direct-fired external heater arranged so that products of combustion are discharged into the oven chamber without any return or recirculation from the oven chamber.  
   *See Figure A.3.3.33.3(a)*

2. **Direct-Fired, External, Recirculating-Through Heater**  
   A direct-fired external heater arranged so that oven atmosphere is recirculated to the oven heater and is in contact with the burner flame.  
   *See Figure A.3.3.33.3(b)*

3. **Direct-Fired, Internal, Nonrecirculating Heater**  
   A combustion chamber of a recirculating oven heater that can be permitted to be built within an oven chamber not substantially separated from the oven atmosphere by gastight construction.

4. **Direct-Fired, External, Recirculating-Not-Through Heater**  
   A heating system constructed so that the oven atmosphere circulates through a blower with products of combustion admitted to the recirculating ductwork but without the oven atmosphere actually passing through the combustion chamber.  
   *See Figure A.3.3.33.3(c)*

## Figures

- **Figure A.3.3.33.3(c)**  
  Example of a Direct-Fired, External, Recirculating-Not-Through Heater. This includes an exhaust fan at the top circulating air downwards, a supply of air, and a recirculating fan, with fresh air coming in to the right and being heated by a heater before returning into the system.

- **Figure A.3.3.33.6**  
  Example of an Indirect-Fired Internal Heating System. An oven contains a radiant heating loop. Air flows through the combustion blower burner into the combustion chamber, then circulates through the radiant heating loop. On the right side of the oven, there is a supply fan and a powered exhaust.

- **Figure A.3.3.33.3(a)**  
  Example of a Direct-Fired, External, Nonrecirculating Heater. This includes an exhaust fan at the top circulating air downwards. A heater fan is located in the middle where fresh air for combustion is pulled in and then the air is heated through the heater.

- **Figure A.3.3.33.3(b)**  
  Example of a Direct-Fired, External, Recirculating-Through Heater. This includes an exhaust fan at the top circulating air downwards, a recirculating fan, with fresh air coming in to the right and being heated by a heater. The air then splits into the supply and the return where it is sent back to the heater for recirculation.

## Additional Heating Systems

### A.3.3.33.6 Indirect-Fired Internal Heating System
Radiators might be designed to withstand explosion pressures from ignition of air-fuel mixtures in the radiators. See Figure A.3.3.33.6 for an example of an indirect-fired internal heating system.

### A.3.3.33.7 Induction Heating System
See *NFPA 70, National Electrical Code*, Article 665.

### A.3.3.33.9 Resistance Heating System
Resistance heaters can be of the open type, with bare heating conductors, or the insulated sheath type, with conductors covered by a protecting sheath that can be filled with electrical insulating material.

## Safety Considerations

### A.3.3.35 Implosion
Implosion can be followed by an outward scattering of pieces of the wall if the wall material is not ductile, thus causing possible danger to nearby equipment and personnel.

### A.3.3.37 Limiting Oxidant Concentration (LOC)
Materials other than oxygen can act as oxidants.

# Document on Ovens and Furnaces

## A.3.3.40.2 Air Jet Mixer

In some cases, this type of mixer can be designed to entrain some of the air for combustion as well as the fuel gas.

## A.3.3.48.1 Low-Oxygen Oven

These ovens normally operate at high solvent levels and can operate safely in this manner by limiting the oxygen concentration within the oven enclosure.

## A.3.3.56.5 Roughing Pump

The roughing pump also can be used as the backing (fore) pump for the diffusion pump, or the roughing pump can be shut off and a smaller pump used as the backing (fore) pump where the gas load is relatively small.

## A.3.3.62 Safe-Start Check

A flame-detected condition could exist due to the presence of actual or simulated flame or due to component failure within the combustion safeguard or flame detector(s).

## A.3.3.63 Safety Device

Safety devices are redundant controls, supplementing controls utilized in the normal operation of a furnace system. Safety devices act automatically, either alone or in conjunction with operating controls, when conditions stray outside of design operating ranges and endanger equipment or personnel.

## A.3.3.69.7 Proof-of-Closure Switch

A common method of effecting proof of closure is by valve seal overtravel.

## A.3.3.78.2 Safety Shutoff Valve

The valve can be opened either manually or automatically, but only after the solenoid coil or other holding mechanism is energized.

## A.3.3.79 Valve Proving System

EN 1643, Valve Proving Systems for Automatic Shut-off Valves for Gas Burners and Gas Appliances, requires leakage to be less than 1.76 ft³/hr (50 L/hr). The definition of proof of closure in ANSI Z21.21/CSA 6.5, Automatic Valves for Gas Appliances, and FM 7400, Approval Standard for Liquid and Gas Safety Shutoff Valves, requires leakage less than 1 ft³/hr (28.32 L/hr).

## A.3.3.81.1 Safety Ventilation

The maximum allowed percent of the lower flammable limit (LFL) is 25 percent when the safety ventilation rate is based upon the calculation methods provided in this standard for Class A ovens. As permitted by this standard, the maximum allowed percent of the lower flammable limit (LFL) may range up to 50 percent when a continuous vapor concentration high-limit controller(s) is used.

## A.4.1 General Requirements

Section 4.1 includes requirements for complete plans, sequence of operations, and specifications to be submitted to the authority having jurisdiction for approval. Application forms such as those in Figure A.4.1 (a) and Figure A.4.1 (b) can be used or might be requested to help the authority having jurisdiction in this approval process. Variations of the forms depend on the type of furnace or oven being furnished, its application, and the authority having jurisdiction. These figures are two historical examples of application forms that are based on older editions of the standard. Forms consistent with current requirements should be used.

### A.4.1.1.2 Schematic Diagrams

Ladder-type schematic diagrams are recommended.

### A.4.1.3.1 Electrical Equipment Proximity

The proximity of electrical equipment and flammable gas or liquid in an electrical enclosure or panel is a known risk and would be considered a classified area. Article 500 of NFPA 70, National Electrical Code, should be consulted. If conduit that connects devices that handle flammable material fails, it might carry the material to an electrical enclosure, creating a classified area in that enclosure. Sealing of such conduits should be considered.

# Annex A: Safety Guidelines for Ovens and Furnaces

## A.4.1.3.4 Classification of Ovens and Furnaces

Unless otherwise required by the local environment, ovens and furnaces and the surrounding area are not classified as hazardous (classified) locations. The primary source of ignition associated with an oven installation is the oven heating system or equipment or the materials heated. The presence of these ignition sources precludes the need for imposing requirements for wiring methods appropriate for a hazardous (classified) location. Refer to NFPA 497, Recommended Practice for the Classification of Flammable Liquids, Gases, or Vapors and of Hazardous (Classified) Locations for Electrical Installations in Chemical Process Areas, and NFPA 499, Recommended Practice for the Classification of Combustible Dusts and of Hazardous (Classified) Locations for Electrical Installations in Chemical Process Areas, regarding equipment with open flames or other ignition sources.

In addition, ovens and furnaces are considered unclassified internally because proven ventilation is provided to ensure safety.

## A.5.1.1 Hazards and Safety Measures

### A.5.1.1.1 Considered Hazards

Hazards to be considered include:
- Molten metal, molten salt, or other molten material spillage
- Quench tanks
- Hydraulic oil ignition
- Overheating of material in the furnace
- Escape of fuel, processing atmospheres, or flue gases

### A.5.1.1.4 Additional Information

For additional information, refer to:
- NFPA 31, Standard for the Installation of Oil-Burning Equipment
- NFPA 54, National Fuel Gas Code
- NFPA 91, Standard for Exhaust Systems for Air Conveying of Vapors, Gases, Mists, and Noncombustible Particulate Solids

### A.5.1.3.4 Vapor Hazards

The hazard is particularly severe where vapors from dipping operations could flow by means of gravity to ignition sources at or near floor level. See:
- NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code
- NFPA 33, Standard for Spray Application Using Flammable or Combustible Materials
- NFPA 34, Standard for Dipping, Coating, and Printing Processes Using Flammable or Combustible Liquids

### A.5.1.4.3 Combustible Floor Safety

If the furnace is located in contact with a wood floor or other combustible floor and the operating temperature is above 160°F (71°C), one or both of the following steps should be adequate to prevent surface temperatures of floor members from exceeding 160°F (71°C):

1. Combustible floor members should be removed and replaced with a monolithic concrete slab that extends a minimum of 3 ft (1 m) beyond the outer extremities of the furnace.
2. Air channels, either naturally or mechanically ventilated, should be provided between the floor and the equipment (perpendicular to the axis of the equipment), or non-combustible insulation should be provided.

## A.5.2 Design Considerations

### A.5.2.3 Safety Factors

Furnace design should include factors of safety to avoid failures when operating at maximum design load.

### A.5.2.4 Additional Design Loads

Consider additional design loads, such as seismic, precipitation, and wind loads where appropriate.

### A.5.2.6.1 Access Facilities

Ladders, walkways, and access facilities, where provided, should be designed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.24 through 29 CFR 1910.29 and with ANSI A14.3, Safety Requirements for Fixed Ladders.

### A.5.2.10 Coolant Flow

Adequate coolant flow is vital to the safe operation of some ovens and furnaces. Where flow switches are provided to verify flow, they should be tested regularly. Other means, such as flow indicators, should also be considered for supplementing the function of flow switches (see A.14.2.4.4).

Testing frequency should be developed from experience and should consider water quality factors. Poor water quality due to scaling or fouling potential and other factors may require more frequent testing. Testing intervals should not extend beyond 1 year.

## Annex A

### A.5.2.13

Fuel-fired or electric heaters should not be located directly under the product being heated where combustible materials could drop and accumulate. Neither should they be located directly over readily ignitable materials such as cotton unless for a controlled exposure period, as in continuous processes where additional automatic provisions, arrangements of guard baffles, or both preclude the possibility of ignition.

### A.5.2.16

See ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII. Also see API 510, Pressure Vessel Inspection Code: In-Service Inspection, Rating, Repair, and Alteration, and API 570, Piping Inspection Code: Inspection, Repair, Alteration, and Rerating of In-Service Piping Systems. Where subject to corrosion, metal parts should be adequately protected.

# Explosion Hazard Mitigation

## A.5.3 Explosion Hazards Mitigation Methods

Explosion hazards can be mitigated by the following methods:

1. Containment
2. Explosion relief
3. Location
4. Explosion suppression
5. Damage-limiting construction

For additional information regarding explosion protection of equipment and buildings, see NFPA 68, Standard on Explosion Protection by Deflagration Venting, and NFPA 69, Standard on Explosion Prevention Systems.

### A.5.3.1 Additional Information on Equipment and Building Relief

For additional information regarding relief of equipment and buildings housing the equipment, see NFPA 68, Standard on Explosion Protection by Deflagration Venting.

#### A.5.3.1(6) Combustion Air Path

Because the combustion air has only one path from the combustion blower through the supervised powered exhaust, there is no buildup of products of combustion in the heat exchanger. The minimum exhaust rate for the heat exchanger should be determined using 11.6.6.1, which states 183 scfm (5.18 standard m³/min) per 1,000,000 Btu/hr (293.1 kW) burner rating. Refer to Figure A.5.3.1(6).

### A.5.3.2 Intent of Explosion Relief in Furnaces

The intent of providing explosion relief in furnaces is to limit damage to the furnace and to reduce the risk of personnel injury due to explosions.

> **Figure**: Diagram of a non-recirculating, indirect-fired oven. The major components are labeled and include the oven, combustion blower burner, supply fan, powered exhaust, combustion chamber, and exhaust.

The historic application of the 1 ft² (0.093 m²) of relief area for each 15 ft³ (0.424 m³) of volume, which is based on industry experience and traditional construction methods, has provided an acceptable level of damage control and personnel protection. Furthermore, controls on fuel concentration (e.g., safety shutoff valves, safety ventilation interlocks) ensure that an upset condition results in only a localized concentration of flammable vapors within the oven volume, thus limiting the energy of the deflagration.

However, the oven designer, manufacturer, and end user should review their specific application and consider the probability of abnormal or "upset" conditions that could lead to concentrations in excess of 25 percent of the LFL distributed throughout the oven volume. A worst-case event involving an explosive mixture distributed throughout the oven volume is likely to require construction and venting design in accordance with NFPA 68, Standard on Explosion Protection by Deflagration Venting, to avoid catastrophic failure of the oven and hazard to personnel and equipment in the vicinity.

Users of this standard are also encouraged to seek out innovative solutions for deflagration venting as a means of overcoming impracticalities associated with traditional venting solutions. Such innovative solutions include weak seam or weak joint construction, damage-limiting construction, self-relieving enclosures, tethered panels, and lifting enclosures. As with any deflagration venting solution, personnel protection is to be considered foremost in the event of a vent-relieving incident.

### A.5.3.5 Location for Explosion Relief

The location for explosion relief is a critical concern and should be close to the ignition source. The heater box is part of the oven system and needs to have explosion relief provided. Personnel considerations and proximity to other obstructions can affect the location selected for explosion-relief vents.

### A.5.3.7 Industry Experience on Oven Enclosure

Industry experience indicates that a typical oven enclosure built to withstand a minimum of a gauge pressure of 0.5 psi (3.45 kPa) surge overpressure with explosion-relief panels having a maximum weight per area of 5 lb/ft² (24.4 kg/m²) meets the requirements of 5.3.7.

### A.5.3.8 Intent of Explosion Relief in Furnaces

The intent of providing explosion relief in furnaces is to limit damage to the furnace and to reduce the risk of personnel injury due to explosions. To achieve those goals, relief panels and doors should be sized so that their inertia does not preclude their ability to relieve internal explosion pressures.

# NFPA Guidelines for Ovens and Furnaces

## A.5.4 Additional Information

For additional information, refer to the following standards:
- **NFPA 31**: Standard for the Installation of Oil-Burning Equipment
- **NFPA 54**: National Fuel Gas Code
- **NFPA 91**: Standard for Exhaust Systems for Air Conveying of Vapors, Gases, Mists, and Noncombustible Particulate Solids

### A.5.4.1 Air Requirements

Most ovens and furnaces rely on the air in a building or room for safety ventilation and combustion. If the oven or furnace fans must compete with other building fans (such as building exhausts), the safety and performance of the oven or furnace could be compromised.

When determining or reviewing the air requirements of a building or room for safety ventilation and combustion, provisions should be made for air being removed from the room for other purposes, such as for removal of heat, flue products, emergency generators, and other combustion equipment. Safety ventilation and combustion air must be in excess of air that is to be removed from the room for other purposes. Seasonal factors could also be relevant in cold climates, where building openings are closed during cold weather.

### Combustion Air for Ovens and Furnaces

In the case of ovens and furnaces, especially those using natural draft (such as bakery ovens), combustion air consistent with requirements identified in Section 9.3 of NFPA 54, National Fuel Gas Code, should be provided.

### A.5.4.3 Duct Considerations

- **A.5.4.3.3**: Ducts that pass through fire walls should be avoided.
- **A.5.4.3.7**: All interior laps in the duct joints should be made in the direction of the flow.
- **A.5.4.3.13**: In many cases, the point of discharge is outside the building, and care should be taken that the discharge is not near an intake or building opening. However, in some cases, the building volume itself is a point of safe discharge, in which case the discharge should not be near areas in which volatiles can collect (unvented ceilings) or intakes (combustion/purge air intakes). Heavier-than-air effluents should not be discharged to the inside of a building.

## A.6.2 Recommendations for Gaseous Fuels

The recommendations of equipment manufacturers should be followed when using gaseous fuels that are not specifically listed in the product literature. For installations using digester gas or landfill gas, **CSA B149.6, Code for Digester Gas and Landfill Gas Installations**, formerly CSA B105, is a recommended resource because it contains safety practices that should be addressed due to the inherent hazards, which are not specifically addressed in NFPA 86, with these types of gases, such as but not limited to oxygen, moisture, or hydrogen sulfide in the gas; use of such gases for a pilot; purging of the gas train; types of materials; or special pressure relief of a digester.

### Ignition Temperature

The term *ignition temperature* means the lowest temperature at which a gas-air mixture will ignite and continue to burn. This condition is also referred to as the auto-ignition temperature. Where burners supplied with a gas-air mixture in the flammable range are heated above the auto-ignition temperature, flashbacks could occur. In general, such temperatures range from 870°F to 1300°F (465°C to 704°C). A much higher temperature is needed to ignite gas dependably. The temperature necessary is slightly higher for natural gas than for manufactured gases; for safety with manufactured gases, a temperature of about 1200°F (649°C) is needed, and for natural gas, a temperature of about 1400°F (760°C) is needed. Additional safety considerations should be given to dirt-laden gases, sulfur-laden gases, high-hydrogen gases, and low-Btu waste gases.

### Flame Propagation

The term *rate of flame propagation* means the speed at which a flame progresses through a combustible gas-air mixture under the pressure, temperature, and mixture conditions existing in the combustion space, burner, or piping under consideration. (See Table A.6.2 and Figure A.6.2.)

# A.6.2 Additional Information

## A.6.2.2

For additional information, refer to NFPA 54, *National Fuel Gas Code*.

## A.6.2.2.4

See A.5.4.1 for information on combustion air supply considerations.

## A.6.2.3.1

The valve used for remote shutoff service should be identified. A number of considerations, including the ability to safely shut down special atmosphere heat treat furnaces, might play a role. If the main incoming service valve is used for this purpose, it must be understood that the valve might be owned by the local utility, which could affect access and service of the valve. Remotely located valves used for shutting down fuel distribution systems that serve a number of users or pieces of equipment should be regularly exercised (by opening and closing several times) to verify their ability to operate when needed. Lubricated plug valves should be maintained annually, including the installation of sealant and leak testing.

## A.6.2.4.2

NFPA 54, *National Fuel Gas Code*, provides sizing methods for gas piping systems.

## A.6.2.5.3

When the fuel train is opened for service, the risk of dirt entry exists. It is not required that existing piping be opened for the sole purpose of the addition of a filter or strainer. It is good practice to have the sediment trap located upstream of the filter. The intent of the sediment trap is to remove larger particulates, while the intent of the filter is to remove smaller particulates. The reverse arrangement will result in additional maintenance and could result in removal of the filter element from service. The mesh size should be sized to protect downstream controls as prescribed by the components' manufacturer(s).

## A.6.2.6.3

Paragraph 6.2.6.3 covers venting of flammable and oxidizing gases only. Gases that are asphyxiants, toxic, or corrosive are outside of the scope of this standard. In this regard, other standards should be consulted for appropriate venting. Flammable gases and oxidizers should be vented to a safe location to prevent fire or explosion hazards. When gases are vented, the vent pipe should be located in accordance with the following:

### Table A.6.2 Properties of Typical Flammable Gases

## ANNEX A: Ignition Velocity and Venting Guidelines

### Ignition Velocity for Flammable Gases

- **Hydrogen**: 3.6 ft/sec
- **Ethylene**: 2.4 ft/sec
- **Carbureted Water Gas**: 2.0 ft/sec
- **Carbon Monoxide**: 1.6 ft/sec
- **Butane/Ethane**: 1.2 ft/sec
- **Producer Gas/Methane/Natural Gas**: 0.8 ft/sec
- **Propane**: 0.4 ft/sec
- **Coke Oven Gas**: 4.0 ft/sec

**Figure A.6.2**: Ignition Velocity Curves for Typical Flammable Gases.

### Venting Guidelines

1. **Avoid Impingement**:
   - Gas should not impinge on equipment, supports, buildings, windows, or materials to prevent fire hazards.
   - Gas should not impinge on personnel or near the exit of the vent pipe to avoid ignition and fire hazards.

2. **Vent Location**:
   - Avoid venting near air intakes, compressor inlets, or devices using ambient air.

3. **Vent Exit Design**:
   - Ensure the pipe exit is free from physical damage or blockages.
   - Size the vent pipe to minimize pressure drop due to length, fittings, and elbows at maximum flow rate.
   - Avoid shutoff valves in the vent line.

4. **Indoor Venting**:
   - Flammable gases lighter than air should be vented to dilute below LFL before contacting ignition sources.
   - Oxygen or oxygen-enriched air should be vented to blend with atmospheric air to maintain 19-23% oxygen levels.

5. **Reference Standards**:
   - Refer to Chapter 4 of NFPA 56 for procedures on discharging flammable gases.
   - See NFPA 54 for exceptions to vent requirements.

### Vent Limiters

- **Purpose**: Limit gas escape into the atmosphere if a vented device fails.
- **Standards**:
  - ANSI Z21.18/CSA 6.3 for gas appliance pressure regulators.
  - ANSI/UL 353 for pressure switches and limit controls.
- **Leakage Rates**:
  - Natural Gas: 2.5 ft³/hr (0.071 m³/hr) for regulators, 1.0 ft³/hr (0.028 m³/hr) for pressure switches.
  - LP-Gas: 1.0 ft³/hr (0.028 m³/hr) for regulators, 1.53 ft³/hr (0.043 m³/hr) for pressure switches.
- **Installation Considerations**:
  - Ensure adequate airflow in the room or enclosure.
  - Consider gas density for dispersion; higher density gases like propane disperse more slowly than natural gas.

**Note**: This information is based on the 2015 Edition of the relevant standards.

## OVENS AND FURNACES

### Airflow and Gas Dispersion

(b) Airflow patterns through a room or enclosure, especially in the vicinity of the gas leak, affect the ability of the air to dilute that gas. The greater the local air movement, the greater the ease with which the gas is able to disperse.

(c) The vent limiter may not prevent the formation of a localized flammable air-gas concentration for the preceding reasons.

### Allowable Leakage Rates

(3) Table A.6.2.6.4 shows various gases and their equivalent allowable leakage rates through a vent limiting device as per ANSI Z21.18/CSA 6.3, *Standard for Gas Appliance Pressure Regulator*. The leakage rates are based on the maximum pressure rating for the device.

**Table A.6.2.6.4 Allowable Leakage Rates of Various Gases**

| Gas Type   | s.g. (based on air = 1.0) | Leakage Rate (ft³/hr) |
| :--------- | :------------------------ | :------------------- |
| Natural gas | 0.65                     | 2.5                  |
| Propane     | 1.50                     | 1.0                  |
| Butane      | 1.95                     | 0.8                  |

### Additional Notes

- **A.6.2.6.5**: See A.6.2.6.4.
- **A.6.2.6.13**: NFPA 86 does not address vents between safety shutoff valves, but they are sometimes installed.
- **A.6.2.6.13(2)**: See A.6.2.6.3.

### Pressure Relief and Safety

- **A.6.2.7.3**: Token relief valves only provide minimum pressure relief in cases where ambient temperatures increase the pressure inside the gas piping, which can occur during shutdown periods, or relieve small increases of pressure due to high lockup pressures that occur during a shutdown.

### Mixture Piping and Safety

- **A.6.2.9.1**: In the design, fabrication, and utilization of mixture piping, it should be recognized that the air-fuel gas mixture might be in the flammable range.

- **A.6.2.9.3(A)**: Two basic methods generally are used. One method uses a separate fire check at each burner, the other a fire check at each group of burners. The second method generally is more practical if a system consists of many closely spaced burners.

- **A.6.2.9.3(E)**: Acceptable safety blowouts are available from some manufacturers of air-fuel mixing machines. They incorporate all the following components and design features:
  1. Flame arrester
  2. Blowout disk
  3. Provision for automatically shutting off the supply of air-gas mixture to the burners in the event of a flashback passing through an automatic fire check

### Testing and Ignition

- **A.6.2.10.7**: Testing of radiant tubes should include subjecting them to thermal cycling typical for the furnace application and then verifying their ability to withstand overpressure developed by a fuel-air explosion. Overpressure testing can be done in one of two ways:
  1. Statically pressurizing the tube until it fails, then comparing this pressure to the maximum pressure (from literature) that can be developed in a contained deflagration of an optimum fuel-air mixture.
  2. Partially blocking the open end of the tube to simulate a heat exchanger, then filling the tube with a well-mixed stoichiometric fuel-air mixture (10 volumes of air to 1 volume of fuel for natural gas). The mixture is ignited at the closed end of the tube, and the pressure that develops is measured and compared to the maximum pressure (from literature) that can be developed in a contained deflagration of an optimum fuel-air mixture.

- **A.6.2.11.1**: A burner is suitably ignited when combustion of the air-fuel mixture is established and stable at the discharge port(s) of the nozzle(s) or in the contiguous combustion tunnel.

### Oil-Fired Units

- **A.6.3**: In the design and use of oil-fired units, the following factors should be considered:
  1. Unlike data on fuel gases, data on many important physical/chemical characteristics are not available for fuel oil, which, being a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, is relatively unpredictable.

## Fuel Oil Vaporization and Combustion

1. **Fuel Oil Vaporization**
   - Fuel oil must be vaporized before combustion. The heat generated by combustion is typically used for this purpose, and the oil remains in the vapor phase as long as the temperature is sufficient. Under these conditions, oil vapor can be treated as fuel gas.

2. **Condensation and Revaporization**
   - Unlike fuel gas, oil vapor condenses into liquid when the temperature drops too low and revaporizes when the temperature rises to an indeterminate point. This characteristic can lead to hazardous conditions in a cold furnace because, unlike fuel gas, oil cannot be purged. Oil vaporizes when the furnace operating temperature is reached.

3. **Temperature and Vapor Pressure**
   - There is no known relationship between temperature and vapor pressure for fuel oil, unlike water. For comparison, a gallon of fuel oil is equivalent to 140 ft³ (4.0 m³) of natural gas; therefore, 1 oz (0.03 kg) of fuel oil equals approximately 1 ft³ (0.03 m³) of natural gas.

4. **Additional Considerations**
   - Other combustible liquids not specified in Section 6.3 require additional considerations beyond the scope of this standard.

### Additional Information

- **A.6.3.2**: For more details, refer to NFPA 31, *Standard for the Installation of Oil-Burning Equipment*.

- **A.6.3.3.4**: A circulating loop, consisting of a supply leg, a back-pressure regulating valve, and a return line to the storage tank, helps reduce air entrainment. Manual vent valves might be needed to bleed air from high points in the oil supply piping.

- **A.6.3.3.6**: The weight of fuel oil is a consideration in vertical runs. When oil moves upward, pressure is lost; a gauge pressure of 100 psi (689 kPa) with a 100 ft (30.5 m) lift results in a gauge pressure of 63 psi (434 kPa). Conversely, when oil moves downward, pressure increases; a gauge pressure of 100 psi (689 kPa) with a 100 ft (30.5 m) drop results in a gauge pressure of 137 psi (945 kPa). This also occurs with fuel gas but is usually insignificant; however, it should not be overlooked with fuel oil.

- **A.6.3.4.1(F)**: Lubricated plug valves require proper lubrication to shut off tightly. The application and type of gas used may necessitate frequent lubrication to maintain the valve's ability to shut off tightly when needed.

- **A.6.3.4.3**: Typically, a filter or strainer is installed in the supply piping to protect the pump. However, the mesh of that filter or strainer is usually not fine enough for burner and valve protection.

- **A.6.3.4.5**: Pressure sensing on fuel oil lines downstream from feed pumps can lead to gauge failure when rapid pulsation exists. Gauge failure can result in fuel oil leakage. The gauge should be removed from service after initial burner startup or periodic burner checks. Alternatively, a pressure snubber can protect the gauge during service.

- **A.6.3.6.1**: The atomizing medium can be steam, compressed air, low-pressure air, air-gas mixture, fuel gas, or other gases. Atomization can also be mechanical, using a mechanical-atomizing tip or rotary cup.

- **A.6.3.8.1**: A burner is suitably ignited when the combustion of the air-fuel mixture is established and stable at the discharge ports of the nozzle(s) or in the contiguous combustion tunnel.

- **A.6.4**: Oxy-fuel burners are often used with arc melting furnaces to augment electric heating. Some burners also use air. Stationary burners are attached to the furnace shell, cover, or both. Movable burners, not normally attached to the furnace, are suspended from structural members outside a furnace door. These burners are manipulated from the operating floor, and oxygen and fuel are introduced into the furnace through long, concentric pipes.

# Safety Considerations for Oxy-Fuel Burners in Arc Furnaces

Conventional flame safeguards are impractical with oxy-fuel burners in arc furnaces due to the radio frequency noise associated with the arcs. The electric arc is a reliable means of ignition for the burners once established. After the arc is established, the high temperatures inside an arc furnace cause the ignition of significant accumulations of oxygen and fuel.

## Hazards of Using Oxygen in Industrial Furnace Heating

Using oxygen to augment or substitute for combustion air in industrial furnace heating systems presents new safety hazards for users familiar only with air-fuel burners.

### Reactivity of Oxygen

One group of hazards arises from the exceptional reactivity of oxygen. It is a potent oxidizer; therefore, it accelerates burning rates and increases the flammability of substances generally considered nonflammable in air. A fire fed by oxygen is difficult to extinguish.

#### Precautions for Oxygen Pipeline Fires

Special precautions are needed to prevent oxygen pipeline fires, where the pipe itself becomes the fuel. Designers and installers of gaseous oxygen piping should familiarize themselves with standards and guidelines on pipe sizing, materials of construction, and sealing methods. Gaseous oxygen should flow at relatively low velocity in pipelines built of ferrous materials, as friction created by particles swept through steel pipe at high speed can ignite a pipeline. For this reason, copper or copper-based alloy construction is customary where high oxygen velocity is needed, such as in valves, valve trim areas, and orifices.

Oxygen pipelines should be cleaned scrupulously to rid them of oil, grease, or any hydrocarbon residues before oxygen is introduced. Valves, controls, and piping elements that come in contact with oxygen should be inspected and certified as "clean for oxygen service." Thread sealants, gaskets, seals, and valve trim should be oxygen-compatible to prevent fires. Proven cleaning and inspection methods are described in the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) publications listed in Annex M.

#### Training and Safety Practices

Furnace operators and others who install or service oxygen piping and controls should be trained in the precautions and safe practices for handling oxygen. For example, smoking or striking a welding arc in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere could start a fire. Gaseous oxygen has no odor and is invisible, so areas with potential leaks are off-limits to smokers and persons doing hot work. Such areas should be posted. Persons who have been in contact with oxygen should be aware that their clothing is extremely flammable until aired. Equipment or devices containing oxygen should never be lubricated or cleaned with agents not approved for oxygen service.

Oxygen suppliers provide chemical material safety data sheets (MSDS) and other precautionary information for employee training. Users are urged to review the safety requirements in this standard and adopt the recommendations.

### Hazards of Oxy-Fuel and Oxygen-Enriched Air Flames

Another group of hazards is created by the nature of oxy-fuel and oxygen-enriched air flames. These flames are exceptionally hot and can damage burners, ruin work in process, and destroy refractory insulation intended for air-fuel heating. Oxygen burner systems and heating controls should have quick-acting, reliable means for controlling heat generation.

Air enriched with oxygen causes fuel to ignite easily, as added oxygen increases the flammability range of air-fuel mixtures. Therefore, pre-ignition purging is critical where oxygen is used.

Oxygen is also a hazard for persons entering furnaces to perform inspections or repairs. Strict entry procedures for confined spaces should be implemented. They should include analyses for excess oxygen (oxygen content in excess of 20.9 percent) in addition to the usual atmosphere tests for oxygen deficiency and flammability.

### A.6.4.3.2

CGA G-4.4, Industrial Practices for Gaseous Oxygen Transmission and Distribution Piping Systems, specifies maximum gas velocity criteria, materials of construction, installation methods, joining methods, metering methods, use of filters, and specifications for oxygen-compatible sealing materials, gasket materials, and thread sealants.

### A.6.4.3.3

See CGA G-4.1, Cleaning Equipment for Oxygen Service.

### A.6.4.3.4

This requirement is intended to prevent the contamination of surfaces that must be clean for oxygen service from the oil normally present in plant compressed air.

### A.6.4.3.8

See A.6.2.6.3

### A.6.4.3.10

See CGA G-4.4, Industrial Practices for Gaseous Oxygen Transmission and Distribution Piping Systems.

### A.6.4.3.12

Commercial grade carbon steel pipe exhibits a marked reduction in impact strength when cooled to subzero temperatures. Consequently, it is vulnerable to impact fracture if located downstream from a liquid oxygen vaporizer running beyond its rated vaporization capacity or at very low ambient temperatures.

### A.6.4.5.2

Diffusers commonly are used to disperse oxygen into an airstream, effecting rapid and complete mixing of the oxygen into the air. High-velocity impingement of oxygen is a potential fire hazard.

### A.6.5.2(2)

The following sample calculation is provided to demonstrate a method of determining the required exhaust flow moving through the collecting and venting system for unsupervised radiant tube burners such that the atmosphere in the collecting and venting system is less than 100 percent LFL, which equals the noncombustible state requirement. The sample calculation is based on the following assumptions:

1. The fuel is methane gas.
2. All burners are not firing.
3. All burner fuel valves are open.
4. The main safety shutoff valve is open.

Overall, the sample calculation is based on the following conservative conditions:

1. Use of the maximum fuel input rate for each burner.
2. Assumption that all burner fuel valves are open.
3. The design limit of <100% of LFL = noncombustible state.
4. Inclusion of the effects of elevated furnace temperature on the LFL.
5. The use of ambient air to dilute the products of combustion exiting the radiant tubes and being conveyed in the collecting and venting system.

The effects of temperature on fuel gas LFL were obtained from Bureau of Mines Bulletin 680, "Investigation of Fire and Explosion Accidents in the Chemical, Mining, and Fuel-Related Industries — A Manual." Figure 34 in that bulletin, "Temperature effect on lower limits of flammability of 10 normal paraffins in air at atmospheric pressure," shows temperature (°C) versus combustibles (volume percent) and includes curves for methane, butane, and propane. It also includes a formula for computing LFL at elevated temperature. The formula, from Bureau of Mines Bulletin 627, "Flammability Characteristics of Combustible Gases and Vapors," is as follows:

\[ L_T = L_{25} [1-0.000721(T-25°C)] \]   [A.6.5.2(2)a]

where:
- \( L_T \) = LFL at the desired elevated temperature \( T \) (°C)
- \( L_{25} \) = LFL at 25°C
- \( T \) = Desired elevated temperature (°C)

#### Sample Problem — U.S. Customary Units

**Objective:** Calculate the exhaust flow moving through the collecting and venting system for unsupervised radiant tube burners so as to maintain the collecting and venting system atmosphere below 100% LFL (i.e., noncombustible state).

**Given the following information:**

# Furnace and Venting System Calculations

## Furnace Specifications

1. **Furnace Type:** Continuous
2. **Fuel:** Methane
3. **Number of Burners:** 10
4. **Maximum Fuel Input per Burner:** 600 scfh
5. **Furnace Temperature:** 1200°F
6. **Radiant Tube Exhaust Temperature:** 2000°F
7. **Collecting and Venting System Temperature:** 500°F (260°C)

## Calculation Steps

### Step 1: Determine LFL at 500°F (260°C)

Using the formula:

\[ L_{500°F} = L_{260°C} = L_{25°C} \left[1-0.000721(T-25°C)\right] \]

\[ = 5.3 \left[1-0.000721(260°C-25°C)\right] \]

\[ = 4.4\% \text{ by volume} \]

### Step 2: Determine Exhaust Flow at 70°F

To control fuel input to <100% LFL:

\[ Q_{EXH\ 70°F\ \&\ 100\%\ LFL} > (Q_{FUEL\ INPUT}) \cdot \left[\frac{(1.0)\% \text{ exhaust volume}}{(LFL_{T\ FCE\ TEMP})/(1.0)\% \text{ fuel volume at } 100\% \text{ LFL}}\right] \]

\[ > [(600 \text{ scfh/burner}) (10 \text{ burners}) (1 \text{ hr}/60 \text{ min})] \cdot (1.0) / (0.044)(1.0) \]

\[ > 2.272 \text{ scfm @ } 70°F \]

### Step 3: Determine Temperature Correction Factor for Volume

\[ T_{CF\ VOL} = \frac{(T_{EXH\ TEMP} + 460°F)}{(70°F + 460°F)} \]

\[ = \frac{(500°F + 460°F)}{(70°F + 460°F)} \]

\[ = 1.81 \]

### Step 4: Determine Exhaust Flow at Operating Temperature

\[ Q_{EXH\ 500°F\ \&\ 100\%\ LFL} > Q_{EXH\ 70°F\ \&\ 100\%\ LFL} \cdot (T_{CF\ VOL}) \]

\[ > (2272 \text{ cfm @ } 70°F)(1.81) \]

\[ > 4112 \text{ cfm @ } 500°F \]

**Conclusion:** The calculated exhaust rate of >4112 scfm @ 500°F is required to keep the collecting and venting system <100% LFL at its operating temperature with all burners off and fuel gas flowing at the maximum input rate.

## Sample Problem — SI Units

### Objective

Calculate the exhaust flow moving through the collecting and venting system for unsupervised radiant tube burners to maintain the system atmosphere below 100% LFL (i.e., noncombustible state).

### Given Information

1. **Oven Type:** Continuous
2. **Fuel:** Methane
3. **Number of Burners:** 10
4. **Maximum Fuel Input per Burner:** 16.99 m³/hr @ 21°C
5. **Furnace Temperature:** 649°C
6. **Radiant Tube Exhaust Temperature:** 1093°C
7. **Collecting and Venting System Temperature:** 500°F (260°C)

### Step 1: Determine LFL at 260°C

\[ L_{500°F} = L_{260°C} = L_{25°C} \left[1-0.000721(T-25°C)\right] \]

\[ = 5.3 \left[1-0.000721(260°C-25°C)\right] \]

\[ = 4.4\% \text{ by volume} \]

### Step 2: Determine Exhaust Airflow at 21°C

\[ Q_{EXH\ 21°C\ \&\ 25\%\ LFL} > (Q_{FUEL\ INPUT}) \cdot \left[\frac{(1.0)\% \text{ exhaust vol.}}{(LFL_{T\ FCE\ TEMP})/(1.0)\% \text{ fuel vol. at } 25\% \text{ LFL}}\right] \]

\[ > [(16.99 \text{ m}³/\text{hr @ } 21°C/\text{burner}) (10 \text{ burners}) (1 \text{ hr}/60 \text{ min})] \cdot (1.0)/(0.044)(1.0) \]

\[ > 64.33 \text{ m}³/\text{min @ } 21°C \]

### Step 3: Determine Temperature Correction Factor for Volume

\[ T_{CF\ VOL} = \frac{(T_{EXH\ TEMP} + 273°C)}{(21°C + 273°C)} \]

\[ = \frac{(260°C + 273°C)}{(21°C + 273°C)} \]

\[ = 1.81 \]

### Step 4: Determine Exhaust Flow at Oven Operating Temperature

\[ Q_{EXH\ 260°C\ \&\ 100\%\ LFL} > Q_{EXH\ 21°C\ \&\ 100\%\ LFL} \cdot (T_{CF\ VOL}) \]

\[ > (64.33\ m^3/\text{min @ } 21°C)(1.81) \]

\[ > 116.63\ m^3/\text{min @ } 260°C \]

# Conclusion

The calculated exhaust rate of >116.63 m³ at 260°C is required to keep the collecting and venting system below 100% LFL at its operating temperature with all burners off and fuel gas flowing at the maximum input rate.

## A.6.5.2(3)

The designer and user are cautioned that hazard conditions can result in common exhaust systems even when the radiant tube burners connected to the common exhaust system are equipped with flame supervision.

## A.6.6.2

Vacuum furnaces using induction, resistance, electron beam, plasma arc, or electric arc heating systems include an electric power supply with a high demand current. High voltage supply used for electron beam, plasma arc, or ion discharge furnace units can have unique safety considerations.

## A.6.6.4.2(A)

Transformers should be of the dry, high fire point type or the less flammable liquid type. Dry transformers should have a 270°F (150°C) rise insulation in compliance with Section 4.03 of NEMATR 27, Commercial, Institutional and Industrial Dry-Type Transformers.

## A.6.7

Fluid heating systems are used to heat lumber dry kilns, plywood veneer dryers, carpet ranges, textile ovens, and chemical reaction vessels. A fluid heating system typically consists of a central heat exchanger to heat the thermal fluid. Firing can be by conventional gas or oil burners. The hot gases pass through a heat exchanger to heat the thermal fluid indirectly. The heat exchanger can be a separate, stand-alone unit or an integral part of the heater. Conventional water-tube boilers have been used as heaters, with thermal fluid replacing the water.

In addition to steam and water, special oils have been developed for this type of application, with flash points of several hundred degrees Fahrenheit. For maximum thermal efficiency, the oils are usually heated above their flash points, making an oil spill especially hazardous. Also, because of the high oil temperatures, it is usually necessary to keep the oil circulating through the heat exchanger at all times to prevent oil breakdown and tube fouling. Diesel-driven pumps or emergency generators are usually provided for this purpose in case of a power outage. Oil circulation can be needed for a period of time even after burner shutdown because of residual heat in the heater.

### A.6.7.1.1

Suitable relief valves should be provided where needed. Where relief valves are provided, they should be piped to a safe location. See design criteria in API STD 520 P1, Sizing, Selection, and Installation of Pressure-Relieving Devices in Refineries, Part 1: Sizing and Selection, and API RP 520 P2, Sizing, Selection, and Installation of Pressure-Relieving Devices in Refineries, Part 2: Installation.

### A.6.7.1.3

If a combustible heat transfer fluid is used, consideration should be given to the use of automatic actuating fire-safe isolation valves. The actuating mechanism should operate even when it is exposed to high temperatures. Fireproofing of the mechanism to maintain operational integrity might be necessary.

A fire-safe valve is one that provides a relatively tight valve-seat shutoff during temperatures that are high enough to destroy seals. The stem packing and gasketed body joints must also be relatively liquidtight during exposure to high temperatures.

## A.7.1.1

Commissioning might be required again following modification, reactivation, or relocation of the furnace.

## A.7.1.3

Typically, inspection and leak tests of furnace piping that conveys flammable liquids or flammable gases are performed at a pressure not less than their normal operating pressure.

## A.7.1.4.1

The testing and verification of the burner management system logic should be completed by a competent person other than the system designer.

## A.7.1.6

It is recommended that all system settings and parameters are documented for future maintenance and operational needs.

# NFPA Guidelines on Fuel and Flammable Gas Handling

## A.7.1.7 Fuel and Flammable Gas Supply

The evacuation/purging, charging, and confirmation of the fuel or flammable gas supply in the piping upstream of the equipment isolation valve is governed by other codes, standards, and recommended practices. One example is Section 8.3 of NFPA 54, which establishes requirements based on the fuel gas pressure, pipe size, and pipe length. Careful consideration should be given to the potential hazards that can be created in the surrounding area for any fuel or flammable gas discharge.

In NFPA 54, the term **appliance shutoff valve** is analogous to the term **equipment isolation valve** in NFPA 86.

NFPA 54 does not address the use of nitrogen for an inert purge and its property as an asphyxiant, nor does it address how to monitor that nitrogen has displaced sufficient oxygen in the piping system prior to the introduction of flammable gas. In this regard, 7.3.5 of NFPA 56 is helpful in identifying the requirements for an oxygen detector, and 7.2.2.3 is helpful for determining an adequate inert (oxygen-depleted) condition.

Paragraphs 7.1.2.1 and 7.1.2.2 of NFPA 56 might also be helpful in engaging the involvement of the fuel gas supplier with the evacuation and charging procedure and implementation.

## A.7.2.1 Training Program Components

The training program might include one or more of the following components:

1. Review of operating and maintenance information
2. Periodic formal instruction
3. Use of simulators
4. Field training
5. Other procedures
6. Comprehension testing

The following training topics should be considered for inclusion when the training program is being developed:

- Process and equipment inspection testing
- Combustion of fuel-air mixtures
- Explosion hazards, including improper purge timing and purge flow and safety ventilation
- Sources of ignition, including auto-ignition (e.g., by incandescent surfaces)
- Functions of controls, safety devices, and maintenance of proper set points
- Handling of special atmospheres
- Handling of low-oxygen atmospheres
- Handling and processing of hazardous materials
- Confined space entry procedures
- Operating instructions (see 7.4.2)
- Lockout/tagout procedures
- Hazardous conditions resulting from interaction with surrounding processes
- Fire protection systems
- Molten material
- Quench systems

## A.7.3.4 Reference to Annexes

See Annex B, Annex C, Annex G, or Annex H, as appropriate.

## A.7.3.8 Modes of Operation

Examples of different modes of operations are oil vs. gas vs. other fuel; dry-out/pre-heat; auto/manual; and normal/standby.

## A.7.4.5 Precision in Operating States

In cases where minimal operating states, such as safety ventilation, must be established to prevent a hazardous condition, it is recommended that the precision of the set point be confirmed. When precision is inadequate, the component should be either recalibrated or replaced. Frequency of this testing and calibration should be established based on the components' mean time between failures (MTBF) data and the component manufacturer's recommendations.

## A.7.4.9 Leak Test Procedure

The following is an example of a leak test procedure for safety shutoff valves on direct gas-fired ovens with a self-piloted burner and intermittent pilot. With the oven burner(s) shut off, the main shutoff valve open, and the manual shutoff valve closed, the procedures are as follows:

1. Place the tube in test connection 1, immersed just below the surface of a container of water.
2. Open the test connection valve. If bubbles appear, the valve is leaking, and the manufacturer's instructions should be referenced for corrective action. Energize the auxiliary power supply to safety shutoff valve No. 1 and open that valve.
3. Place the tube in test connection 2, immersed just below the surface of a container of water.

(4) Open the test connection valve. If bubbles appear, the valve is leaking. Reference the manufacturer's instructions for corrective action.

This procedure is predicated on the piping diagram shown in Figure A.7.4.9(a) and the wiring diagram shown in Figure A.7.4.9(b).

### Gas Supply to Burner System

- **Safety Leak Shutoff Test Valve No. 1**
- **Safety Leak Shutoff Test Valve No. 2**

**FIGURE A.7.4.9(a)** Example of a Gas Piping Diagram for Leak Test.

> **Figure**: This is a wiring diagram illustrating a leak test setup. On the left side of the diagram is 'H', and a Flame safeguard. A line extends from the flame safeguard to a Momentary leak test switch. A line extends from the Momentary leak test switch to the Auxiliary switch for safety shutoff valve No. 1. On the right side of the diagram is 'N', Safety shutoff valve No. 1, and Safety shutoff valve No. 2. Safety shutoff valve No. 1 and Safety shutoff valve No. 2 connect through the Auxiliary switch for safety shutoff valve No. 1.

**FIGURE A.7.4.9(b)** Example of a Wiring Diagram for Leak Test.

It is recognized that safety shutoff valves are not entirely leak-free. Because valve seats can deteriorate over time, they require periodic leak testing. Many variables are associated with the valve seat leak testing process, including gas piping and valve size, gas pressure and specific gravity, size of the burner chamber, length of downtime, and the many leakage rates published by recognized laboratories and other organizations.

Leakage rates are published for new valves and vary by manufacturer and the individual listings to which the manufacturer subscribes. It is not expected that valves in service can be held to these published leakage rates, but rather that the leakage rates are comparable over a series of tests over time. Any significant deviation from the comparable leakage rates over time will indicate to the user that successive leakage tests can indicate unsafe conditions. These conditions should then be addressed by the user in a timely manner.

The location of the manual shutoff valve downstream of the safety shutoff valve affects the volume downstream of the safety shutoff valve and is an important factor in determining when to start counting bubbles during a safety shutoff valve seat leakage test. The greater the volume downstream of the safety shutoff valve, the longer it will take to fully charge the trapped volume in the pipe between the safety shutoff valve and the manual shutoff valve. This trapped volume needs to be fully charged before starting the leak test.

Care should be exercised when performing the safety shutoff valve seat leakage test, because flammable gases will be released into the local environment at some indeterminate pressure. Particular attention should be paid to lubricated plug valves used as manual shutoff valves to ensure that they have been properly serviced prior to the valve seat leakage test.

The publications listed in Annex M include examples, although not all-inclusive, of acceptable leakage rate methodologies that the user can employ.

Figures A.7.4.9(a) through A.7.4.9(c) show examples of gas piping and wiring diagrams for leak testing.

**Example**: The following example is predicated on the piping diagram shown in Figure A.7.4.9(a) and the wiring diagram shown in Figure A.7.4.9(b).

**FIGURE A.7.4.9(c)** Leak Test for a Safety Shutoff Valve.

# Procedures for Leak Testing

With the oven burner(s) shut off, the equipment isolation valve open, and the manual shutoff valve located downstream of the second safety shutoff valve closed, the procedures are as follows:

1. **Connect the tube to leak test valve No. 1.**

2. **Bleed trapped gas by opening leak test valve No. 1.**

3. **Immerse the tube in water as shown in Figure A.7.4.9(c).**  
   If bubbles appear, the valve is leaking. Reference the manufacturer's instructions for corrective action. Examples of acceptable leakage rates are given in Table A.7.4.9(a).

4. **Apply auxiliary power to safety shutoff valve No. 1.**  
   Close leak test valve No. 1. Connect the tube to leak test valve No. 2 and immerse it in water as shown in Figure A.7.4.9(c).

5. **Open leak test valve No. 2.**  
   If bubbles appear, the valve is leaking. Reference the manufacturer's instructions for corrective action. Examples of acceptable leakage rates are given in Table A.7.4.9(a).

## Leakage Rate Calculation

\[ L = \frac{|\Delta p| \times V_{test} \times 3600}{P_{atm} \times T_{test}} \]

Where:

- **L** = leakage rate (cm³/hr)
- **|\(\Delta p\)|** = absolute value of initial test pressure (mbar) – final test pressure (mbar)
- **\(V_{test}\)** = total volume of the test (cm³)
- **\(P_{atm}\)** = atmospheric pressure (atmospheres)
- **\(T_{test}\)** = test time (seconds)

### Conversion Factors

- 1 in. water col. = 2.44 mbar
- 1 psi = 27.7 in. water col.
- 1 atmosphere = 14.7 psi

This test method can be done by tapping into the following ports and performing the test method in Table A.7.4.9(b).

### Table A.7.4.9(b) Test Methods

| Test Port Location | Test Method |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| A test port between both safety shutoff valves | Pressure decay on \(V_2\) |
| A test port downstream of both safety shutoff valves | Pressure rise on \(V_1\) |
|  | Pressure rise on \(V_1\) and \(V_2\) (requires manual shutoff valve downstream both safety shutoff valves and that it be leak tightness tested). |
| A test port upstream of both valves | Pressure decay on \(V_1\) and \(V_2\) (requires a leak tightness test on the upstream, manual isolation valve) |

## Maintenance and Safety

### A.7.4.10.2

Where a means is not provided to count the actual number of safety shutoff valve cycles, it becomes a maintenance responsibility to maintain an estimate of safety shutoff valve cycles so that the safety shutoff valve is replaced before it exceeds 90 percent of the life cycles established by the safety shutoff valve manufacturer.

### A.7.4.12

Lubricated plug valves require lubrication with the proper lubricant in order to shut off tightly. The application and type of gas used can require frequent lubrication to maintain the ability of the valve to shut off tightly when needed.

### A.7.4.13

Exercising the valve means that the valve is operated but not necessarily through the full range.

### A.7.4.14

See CGA G-4.1, *Cleaning Equipment for Oxygen Service*, and CGA G-4.4, *Industrial Practices for Gaseous Oxygen Transmission and Distribution Piping Systems*.

## Ovens and Furnaces

### A.7.4.15
The intent is to verify that the temperature indicator of the excess temperature controller is reading correctly.

### A.7.4.19
See A.6.2.6.3.

### A.7.6
Procedures for confined space entry can be found in 29 CFR 1910.146, "Permit-Required Confined Spaces," and ANSI Z117.1, *Safety Requirements for Confined Spaces*. Information on hazards of chemicals can be found in *NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards*.

### A.8.1
For the protection of personnel and property, consideration should be given to the supervision and monitoring of conditions that could cause or that could lead to a potential hazard on any installation.

### A.8.2.1
A flame rod is not required to be listed.

### A.8.2.2
The AHJ should consider reliability and durability during the selection process when approving a device.

### A.8.2.3
Consideration should be given to the effects of radiant heat on the safety devices. Radiant heat can cause safety devices to be exposed to temperatures greater than their ratings. Adequate insulation, heat shields, ventilation, or other measures should be used in cases where radiant heat causes safety devices to reach temperatures above their ratings.

### A.8.2.9
The actions resulting from a manual emergency switch action take into account the individual system design and the hazards (e.g., mechanical, combustion system, special atmosphere, etc.) associated with changing the existing state to another state and initiates actions to cause the system to revert to a safe condition. For some applications, additional manual action may be required to bring the process to a safe condition.

### A.8.2.10
The manual intervention applies only to shutdowns of a safety function. Safety devices such as burner safeguard controllers can contain non-safety-related control sequences that can shut down the heating system due to a process control function, such as temperature control. Even though the action is within a safety device, the shutdown is not by a safety function.

### A.8.2.11
A single pressure transmitter with associated logic can be used to provide both of the required low and high pressure interlock functions. A single flow transmitter with associated logic can be used to provide both of the required low and high flow interlock functions.

# A.8.3 Furnace Controls

Furnace controls that meet the performance-based requirements of standards such as ANSI/ISA 84.00.01, *Application of Safety Instrumented Systems for the Process Industries*, and IEC 61511, *Functional Safety: Safety Instruments Systems for the Process Industry Sector*, can be considered equivalent. The determination of equivalency will involve complete conformance to the safety life cycle, including risk analysis, safety integrity level selection, and safety integrity level verification, which should be submitted to the authority having jurisdiction.

## A.8.3.1.4 Control Circuit and Components

The control circuit and its non-furnace-mounted or furnace-mounted control and safety components should be housed in a dust-tight panel or cabinet, protected by partitions or secondary barriers, or separated by sufficient spacing from electrical controls employed in the higher voltage furnace power system. Related instruments might or might not be installed in the same control cabinet. The door providing access to this control enclosure might include means for mechanical interlock with the main disconnect device required in the furnace power supply circuit.

Temperatures within this control enclosure should be limited to 125°F (52°C) for suitable operation of plastic components, thermal elements, fuses, and various mechanisms that are employed in the control circuit.

# A.8.4 PLC Approach to Combustion Interlocks - Multiburner

1. Interlocks relating to purge are done via PLC.
2. The purge timer is implemented in PLC.
3. Interlocks relating to combustion air and gas pressure are done via PLC.
4. Gas valves for pilots and burners directly connected to flame safeguards must conform to the requirements of 8.8.2.
5. Operation of pilot and burner gas valves must be confirmed by the PLC.
6. A PLC can be set up as intermittent, interrupted, or constant pilot operation. With an appropriate flame safeguard, it would be possible to provide an interrupted pilot with one flame sensor and one flame safeguard.

## A.8.4.2 Compliance with Manufacturer's Safety Manual

Compliance with the manufacturer's safety manual would achieve actions such as, but not limited to, the PLC detecting the following:

1. Failure to execute any program or task containing safety logic
2. Failure to communicate with any safety I/O
3. Changes in software set points of safety functions
4. Failure of outputs related to safety functions
5. Failure of timing related to safety functions

An SIL 3-capable PLC includes third-party certification, the actions above, and partitioning to separate safety logic from process logic. The requirements for SIL capability in 8.4.2 pertain only to the PLC and its I/O and not to the implementation of the burner management system. The purpose of the SIL capability requirement is to provide control reliability.

## A.8.4.4 Burner Management System Logic

The burner management system logic, memory, and I/O should be characterized by the following:

1. Independent from nonsafety logic and memory
2. Protected from alteration by non-BMS logic or memory access
3. Protected from alteration by unauthorized users

### A.8.4.4(A) Signal Transmission

This standard requires that the signal from the safety device be directly transmitted to the safety PLC input. Once the safety PLC processes the signal, the resulting data can be used for any purpose.

# A.8.5.1.1 Procedures for Flammable Atmospheres

Procedures for admitting and withdrawing flammable special processing atmospheres are covered in Chapter 13.

In some applications, purging with the furnace doors open could force combustible or indeterminate gases into the work area and the area surrounding the furnace, thereby creating a potential hazard to those areas. Purging with the doors closed ensures that furnace gases exit out of the furnace through the intended flue or exhaust system.

Igniting the furnace burners with the furnace doors open is an effective way to avoid containment during the ignition cycle.

## ANNEX A

### A.8.5.1.2 Equipment Considerations

Equipment that is not explosion resistant, lacks a combustion air blower or exhaust blower, and relies on natural draft to meet the purge requirements of this section should address the following conditions to ensure conformance:

1. **Natural Draft Flow Rate**: 
   - The flow rate can be affected by furnace doors, covers, and dampers. If the purge rate and timing depend on the setting of these devices, they should be interlocked to meet the requirements in 8.5.1.2(C)(1), 8.5.1.2(D), and 8.5.1.2(E).

2. **Proof of Minimum Required Purge Flow**: 
   - This should handle cases where the natural draft flow rate can be affected by pressure differences between the heating chamber and the inside or outside of the building.

3. **Specific Gravity of Fuel**: 
   - The design of the furnace purge path must consider the specific gravity of the fuel. For example, there should be no collection areas at the bottom of the heating chamber with a heavier-than-air fuel gas.

4. **Unknown Purge Flow Rate**: 
   - If the purge flow rate is not known or directly proved, the purge time set in the timer should be determined by measurement. The party commissioning the burner system is responsible for this measurement and documentation. The measurement should be conducted when the furnace is at normal ambient temperature and its lowest purge flow rate. Confirming calculations and measurement data should be available for review in accordance with Chapter 7. Combustible gas analyzers and oxygen analyzers should be used to measure the time from the end of unburned gas release for the trial-for-ignition period until the combustible concentration of the system volume is below 25 percent LFL. The test should be repeated immediately for a second release of gas and time delay to ensure that the measurement is still below 25 percent LFL. If it is not, the purge time must be increased, with repeated purge and trial-for-ignition sequences, until there is no successive buildup of the combustible concentration.

### A.8.5.1.2(C) Specific Equipment Considerations

1. **Thermal Oxidizers**: 
   - Equipment such as thermal oxidizers commonly process sources of contaminated air. Contaminated air is an indeterminate purge medium. The design of the pre-ignition airflow interlocks should incorporate a means to prove a source of fresh air and also prove the isolation of contaminated air sources during pre-ignition purge. In complex systems involving multiple sources where it is not always possible to shut down all indeterminate sources, providing a fresh air source and positive isolation from all contaminated sources is necessary to ensure proper pre-ignition purging.

2. **Figure Reference**: 
   - See Figure A.8.5.1.2(C)(2).

### A.8.5.1.8 Continuing Provisions

The following sections of this standard continue to apply where the provisions of 8.5.1.8 are applied:

1. **Combustion Air Safety Device Requirements**: 
   - Refer to Section 8.7.

2. **Supervision of Burners and Pilots**: 
   - Each burner and pilot is supervised by a combustion safeguard in accordance with Section 8.10.

3. **Safety Shutoff Valves**: 
   - Each burner system is equipped with safety shutoff valves in accordance with Section 8.8.

#### A.8.5.1.8(2)(a) Considerations for Operating Burners

Consideration should be given to the proximity of operating burners when the common combustion chamber exception to repeating purges is utilized. Accumulation of localized vapors or atmospheres is possible even with an operating burner in a chamber, depending on the size of the chamber, the number of burners, and the proximity of operating burners.

The accumulation of vapors or gases can be influenced by several factors, including the proximity of burners, burner design, and the exposure of the flame. These factors may affect the ability of the operating burner to mitigate vapor or gaseous accumulations.

### A.8.5.1.8(3) Sample Calculation for 25 Percent LFL Requirement

The following sample calculation demonstrates a method for determining the 25 percent Lower Flammable Limit (LFL) requirement. The calculation is based on the following assumptions:

1. The fuel is methane gas.
2. All burners are off, and all safety shutoff valves are de-energized.
3. All burner safety shutoff valves fail to function and remain fully open during the period that the burners are off.
4. Safety shutoff valve leakage is equal to the maximum burner fuel input rate.

Overall, the sample calculation is based on these conservative conditions:

- The use of the maximum fuel input rate for each burner
- Failure of all burner safety shutoff valves to close
- Design limit of 25 percent of LFL
- Inclusion of the effects of elevated furnace temperature on the LFL

The effects of temperature on fuel gas LFL were obtained from Bureau of Mines Bulletin 680, "Investigation of Fire and Explosion Accidents in the Chemical, Mining, and Fuel-Related Industries — A Manual." Figure 34 in that bulletin, "Temperature effect on lower limits of flammability of 10 normal paraffins in air at atmospheric pressure," shows temperature (°C) versus combustibles (volume percent) and includes curves for methane, butane, and propane.

# OVENS AND FURNACES

Given the following information:

1. **Oven type**: Continuous
2. **Fuel**: Methane
3. **Number of burners**: 5
4. **Maximum fuel input per burner**: 28.32 m³/hr @ 21°C
5. **Oven temperature**: 135°C
6. **Exhaust airflow rate**: 283.2 m³/min

## Formula for Computing LFL at Elevated Temperature

The formula, from Bureau of Mines Bulletin 627, "Flammability Characteristics of Combustible Gases and Vapors," is as follows:

\[ L_T = L_{25} [1-0.000721(T-25°C)] \]

Where:
- \( L_T \) = LFL at the desired elevated temperature, T (°C)
- \( L_{25} \) = LFL at 25°C
- \( T \) = Desired elevated temperature (°C)

### Sample Problem — U.S. Customary Units

**Objective**: Calculate the airflow rate moving through the oven.

\[ L_{275°F} = L_{135°C} = L_{25°C} [1-0.000721(T-25°C)] \]

\[ = 5.3 [1-0.000721(135°C-25°C)] \]

\[ = 4.9\% \text{ by volume} \]

## ANNEX A

### Safety Shutoff Valve Seat Leakage

1. **Testing Frequency**:  
   - All safety shutoff valves are tested for seat leakage at least semiannually.

2. **Assumed Leakage Rate**:  
   - Safety shutoff valve seat leakage is assumed to be 1 scfh (0.0283 m³/hr @ 21°C).

3. **Selection of Leakage Rate**:  
   - Limited data reviewed by the committee indicate that valve seat leakage rates over 1 scfh (0.0283 m³/hr @ 21°C) are not anticipated unless the safety shutoff valve seats are exposed to extremely unusual conditions such as corrosives in the fuel gas or furnace heat allowed to back up the fuel line and burn the safety shutoff valve seat.
   - The former condition is the basis for limiting the use of 8.5.1.8(4) to furnaces using natural gas, butane, or propane fuel gases.
   - The latter condition occurred in a case where a fuel line was inappropriately opened by maintenance staff while the furnace was in operation. The furnace was promptly shut down, and the safety shutoff valves were replaced.

4. **Operating Conditions**:  
   - Under expected operating conditions, debris from internal fuel gas line oxidation (rust), pipe thread shavings not removed before fuel line assembly, or similar exposures can subject one safety shutoff valve to seat damage that can lead to seat leakage. However, it is not expected that both safety shutoff valves would experience similar seat leakage.
   - The selected safety shutoff valve seat leakage rate of 1 scfh (0.0283 m³/hr @ 21°C) is considered conservative.

5. **Conservative Conditions for Sample Calculation**:  
   - Using a safety shutoff valve seat leakage rate of 1 scfh (0.0283 m³/hr @ 21°C).
   - Providing two safety shutoff valves for each fuel path.
   - Closing two valves or using proof of closure if closing one valve.
   - Assuming safety shutoff valve leakage at each burner fuel path.
   - Using a design limit of 25 percent of LFL.
   - Including the effects of elevated furnace temperature on the LFL.
   - Assuming no fuel exits the furnace.

### Effects of Temperature on Fuel Gas LFL

- The effects of temperature on fuel gas LFL were obtained from Bureau of Mines Bulletin 680, "Investigation of Fire and Explosion Accidents in the Chemical, Mining, and Fuel-Related Industries - A Manual."
- Figure 34 in that bulletin, "Temperature effect on lower limits of flammability of 10 normal paraffins in air at atmospheric pressure," shows temperature (°C) versus combustibles (volume percent) and includes curves for methane, butane, and propane.
- It also includes a formula for computing LFL at elevated temperature. That formula, based on Bureau of Mines Bulletin 627, "Flammability Characteristics of Combustible Gases and Vapors," is as follows:

\[ L_T = L_{25} [1-0.000721(T-25°C)] \]

where:  
- \( L_T \) = LFL at the desired elevated temperature, T (°C)  
- \( L_{25} \) = LFL at 25°C  
- T = Desired elevated temperature (°C)

### Sample Problem — U.S. Customary Units

**Objective**: Calculate the amount of time that all burners can be turned off before the furnace atmosphere will reach 25 percent LFL.

## Assumptions

- Furnace contains no combustibles when the burners are turned off.
- Furnace is under positive pressure with no air infiltration.

### Given Information

- **Furnace Type**: Batch
- **Furnace Size**: 8 ft wide × 6 ft deep × 8 ft tall
- **Number of Burners**: 5
- **Burner Design Rate**: 0.8 MM Btu/hr
- **Burner Design Excess Air**: 10.0%
- **Burner Design Air Capacity**: 8800 scfh
- **Burner Air Minimum Design Flow**: 100 scfh
- **Maximum Leak Rate Each Flow Path**: 1 scfh
- **Number of Burner Flow Paths**: 5
- **Furnace Temperature**: 900°F (482°C)
- **Oxygen in Furnace Atmosphere**: 18%
- **Fuel**: Methane

*Note: The flow path is across one set of closed safety shutoff valves. The number of flow paths is the number of sets of safety shutoff valves that are closed that can leak into the furnace enclosure.*

## Calculations

### Step 1: Determine LFL at 900°F

\[ L_{900°F} = L_{482°C} = L_{25°C} [1-0.000721(T-25°C)] \]

\[ = 5.3[1-0.000721(482°C -25°C)] \]

\[ = 3.6\% \text{ by volume} \]

### Step 2: Determine the Furnace Volume

\[ V_{FCE} = L \times W \times H = 8 \, \text{ft} \times 6 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} = 384 \, \text{ft}³ \]

### Step 3: Determine the Methane Leak Rate

\[ Q_{LEAK} = \# \text{ flow paths} \times \text{leak rate per path} \]

\[ = 5 \, \text{paths} \times 1 \, \text{scfh/path} \]

\[ = 5 \, \text{scfh} \]

### Step 4: Determine the Airflow into the Furnace

\[ Q_{AIR} = \# \text{burners} \times \text{airflow rate per idle burner} \]

\[ = 5 \, \text{burners} \times 100 \, \text{scfh/burner} \]

\[ = 500 \, \text{scfh} \]

### Step 5: Determine the Percent Volume Methane to Air

\[ \% \text{volume methane to air} = \left(\frac{Q_{LEAK}}{Q_{AIR}}\right)(100\%) \]

\[ = \left(\frac{5 \, \text{scfh}}{500 \, \text{scfh}}\right)(100\%) \]

\[ = 1\% \]

### Step 6: Determine the Percent LFL at 900°F

\[ \%LFL_{900°F} = \left(\frac{\% \text{volume methane to air}}{LFL_{900°F}}\right)(100\%) \]

\[ = \left(\frac{1\%}{3.6\%}\right)(100\%) \]

\[ = 28.57\% \]

### Step 7: Determine the Time to Reach 25% LFL

\[ t_{FCE \% 25\% LFL} = \left[\frac{(L_{900°F}) (0.25)}{(Q_{LEAK}/V_{FCE})}\right](60 \, \text{min/hr}) \]

\[ = \left[\frac{(0.036)(0.25)}{(5 \, \text{ft}³/\text{hr}/384 \, \text{ft}³)}\right] (60 \, \text{min/hr}) \]

\[ = 41.5 \, \text{minutes} \]

## Conclusions

- Where the value of percent \( LFL_{900°F} \) exceeds 25 percent, the burner safety shutoff valves can remain closed and burners be reignited without a repurge within a period of time not exceeding \( _{FCE} \) 25% LFL. After \( _{FCE} \) 25% LFL is exceeded, a repurge of the furnace is required.
- Where the value of percent \( LFL_{900°F} \) equals or is less than 25 percent, burners can be reignited at any time as long as the airflow rate \( Q_{AIR} \) is proven and interlocked in the burner management system such that loss of this proven airflow rate will require a repurge of the furnace before burner reignition is permitted.

### Assumptions

- Furnace contains no combustibles when the burners are turned off.
- Furnace is under positive pressure with no air infiltration.

### Given Information

- **Furnace Type**: Batch
- **Furnace Size**: 2.438 m wide × 1.828 m deep × 2.428 m tall

- **Fuel**: Methane

*Note: The flow path is across one set of closed safety shutoff valves. The number of flow paths is the number of sets of safety shutoff valves that are closed that can leak into the furnace enclosure.*

### Step 1: Determine LFL at 482°C

\[ L_{482°C} = L_{25} [1-0.000721(T-25°C)] \]

\[ = 5.3(1-0.000721)(482°C -25°C) \]

\[ = 3.6\% \text{ by volume} \]

### Step 2: Determine the Furnace Volume

\[ V_{FCE} = L \times W \times H = 2.438 \, \text{m} \times 1.828 \, \text{m} \times 2.428 \, \text{m} = 10.87 \, \text{m}³ \]

### Step 3: Determine the Methane Leak Rate into the Furnace with All Burners Off

\[ Q_{\text{LEAK}} = \text{\#flow paths} \times \text{leak rate per path} \]

\[ = 5 \text{ paths} \times 0.0283 \, \text{m}^3/\text{hr} \, @ \, 21°C/\text{path} \]

\[ = 0.142 \, \text{m}^3/\text{hr} \, @ \, 21°C \]

### Step 4: Determine the Airflow into the Furnace with All Burners Off

\[ Q_{\text{AIR}} = \text{\# burners} \times \text{airflow rate per idle burner} \]

\[ = 5 \text{ burners} \times 2.83 \, \text{m}^3/\text{hr} \, @ \, 21°C/\text{burner} \]

\[ = 14.2 \, \text{m}^3/\text{hr} \, @ \, 21°C \]

### Step 5: Determine the Percent Volume Methane to Air Through All Burners

\[ \% \text{ vol. methane to air} = \left(\frac{Q_{\text{LEAK}}}{Q_{\text{AIR}}}\right) \times 100\% \]

\[ = \left(\frac{0.142 \, \text{m}^3/\text{hr} \, @ \, 21°C}{14.2 \, \text{m}^3/\text{hr} \, @ \, 21°C}\right) \times 100\% \]

\[ = 1\% \]

### Step 6: Determine the Percent LFL Resulting from the Methane Flow Through All Burner Fuel Paths at 482°C

\[ \%LFL_{482°C} = \left(\frac{\% \text{ volume methane to air}}{LFL_{482°C}}\right) \times 100\% \]

\[ = \left(\frac{1\%}{3.5\%}\right) \times 100\% \]

\[ = 28.57\% \]

### Step 7: Determine the Time in Minutes to Reach 25 Percent LFL with All Burners Off

\[ _{FCE} 25\% LFL = \left[\left(L_{482°C}\right) \times 0.25\right] / \left[\left(Q_{\text{LEAK}}/V_{FCE}\right)\right] \times (60 \, \text{min/hr}) \]

\[ = \left[\left(0.036\right) \times 0.25 / \left(0.142 \, \text{m}^3/\text{hr}\right) \times (10.87 \, \text{m}^3)\right] \times (60 \, \text{min/hr}) \]

\[ = 41.3 \, \text{minutes} \]

### Conclusions

Where the value of percent \( LFL_{482°C} \) exceeds 25 percent, the burner safety shutoff valves can remain closed and burners be reignited without a repurge within a period of time not exceeding \( _{FCE} 25\% LFL \). After \( _{FCE} 25\% LFL \) is exceeded, a repurge of the furnace is required.

Where the value of percent \( LFL_{482°C} \) equals or is less than 25 percent, burners can be reignited at any time as long as the airflow rate \( Q_{\text{AIR}} \) is proven and interlocked in the burner management system such that loss of this proven airflow rate will require a repurge of the furnace before burner reignition is permitted.

### A.8.5.2

When the purge is complete, there should be a limit to the time between purge complete and trial for ignition. Delay can result in the need for a repurge.

### A.8.6.1

Use of a rotational switch is an acceptable means of proving operation of a fan where the impeller is not located in a dedicated housing (nonducted). A Hall effect sensor is one example of a device that can be used to prove fan shaft rotation. Regular inspection of the impeller may be required to ensure original performance is maintained (i.e., blades still attached, angles on blades correct, etc.).

### A.8.7.4

In industrial combustion applications with modulating flow control valves downstream of the combustion air blower, it is most common to interlock the constant combustion air source pressure on single and multiburner systems to meet the requirements of 8.7.2 and 8.7.4.

Because the combustion airflow is proved during each purge cycle along with the combustion air source pressure, the most common convention is to prove the combustion air source pressure during burner operation following purge. In a multiburner system, the proof of combustion airflow during purge proves that any manual valves in the combustion air system are in an adequately open position. These manual air valves are provided for maintenance and combustion airflow balancing among burners in a temperature control zone. In combustion air supply systems that use either an inlet damper or a speed control, the combustion air pressure can fall below reliably repeatable levels with listed pressure switch interlocks at low fire. For these systems, the proof of minimum airflow can be a more reliable interlock.

A pressure switch on the inlet (suction) side of an induced draft (ID) fan can be used to prove that the minimum required suction pressure is available.

For combustion systems that use high-pressure gas/air to induce (inspirate) air locally at each burner, it is impractical to monitor and prove the availability of combustion air. Similarly, for combustion systems that use natural (stack) draft to induce air into the burners or combustion chamber, it is also impractical to monitor and prove the availability of combustion air.

### A.8.7.5
The maximum safe operating pressure can be exceeded where compressed air is utilized.

### A.8.8.1.2
See Figure A.8.8.1.2.

**Interlocked with upstream safety shutoff valve to comply with 8.8.1.3**

**FIGURE A.8.8.1.2** Multiple Burner System Using Proof-of-Closure Switches.

### A.8.8.1.3
Paragraph 8.8.1.3 addresses conditions under which only one safety shutoff valve is to close to isolate a burner from its fuel gas supply. Figure A.8.8.1.3 provides a summary of 8.8.1.3 in the form of a decision tree. See 8.5.1.7 and 8.5.1.8 for guidance regarding conditions that are needed to allow that burner to be placed back in service. The requirements of 8.5.1.8 might not allow a burner shut off by closing a single safety shutoff valve to be placed back in service without repeating a pre-ignition purge.

The requirements of 8.8.1.3 do not preclude opening of the safety shutoff valve located upstream of the individual burners using single safety shutoff valves during the trial for ignition for the first burner being lighted.

### A.8.8.1.3(2)
See A.8.5.1.8(3) for a sample calculation to demonstrate a method of determining the 25 percent LFL requirement.

### A.8.8.1.10
Backpressure can lift a valve from its seat, permitting furnace gases to enter the fuel system. Examples of situations that create backpressure conditions are leak testing, furnace backpressure, combustion air pressure during prepurge, and fluidized bed furnaces.

### A.8.8.2.2
An additional safety shutoff valve located to be common to the furnace system and proved closed and interlocked with the pre-ignition purge circuit can be used to meet the requirements of 8.8.2.2.

**FIGURE A.8.8.1.3** Safety Shutoff Decision Tree.

### A.8.8.3.2
An additional safety shutoff valve located to be common to the furnace system and proved closed and interlocked with the pre-ignition purge circuit can be used to meet the requirements of 8.8.3.2.

### A.8.9
A system designer can choose not to use pressure switches in a pilot. However, gas pressure switches on a pilot can be desirable, and the following conditions should be considered in deciding whether or not switches should be used:

1. **Continuous Pilot**: If a reliable pilot after light off is still a desirable part of the safety during operation of the burner, the switches help prove the reliability of the pilot so that the gas pressure to the pilot is proven to be within designed parameters.

2. **Pilot Burner Capacity Above 400,000 Btu/hr**: Direct sparking a burner in excess of 400,000 Btu/hr could introduce added risks if a delayed ignition occurs due to too much or too little gas pressure.

3. **Pilot Burner Uses Its Own Pressure Regulator**: Failure of that regulator could cause instability of the burner or expose downstream components to pressures exceeding their ratings.

### Pilot Regulator and Overpressure Protection

1. **Inlet Pressure Concerns**  
   If the inlet pressure to the pilot regulator exceeds 1/2 psi, the risk of a problem due to incorrect gas pressure increases. The failure or overloading of a pilot regulator is at a significantly higher risk where inlet pressures exceed 12 psi.

2. **Overpressure Protection**  
   To comply with section 6.2.7, overpressure protection for a pilot line can be achieved by using a high gas pressure switch on the pilot line in combination with a shutoff valve.

### Flame Detection and Combustion Safeguards

- **Installation Requirements**  
  Subsections 8.2.2 and 8.2.5 require that the flame detector and the combustion safeguard be applied and installed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Continuous operation without a shutdown beyond the maximum interval recommended by the manufacturer is non-compliant.

- **Ultraviolet Sensors**  
  Ultraviolet sensors can fail to detect the loss of flame. Failures can be detected by a self-checking ultraviolet detector or by periodic testing.

### Safety Shutoff Valve (SSOV) Response Times

- **Response Time Requirements**  
  Figure A.8.10.3 illustrates the sequences needed to achieve a safety shutoff valve (SSOV) closing time of not more than 5 seconds following the loss of flame. Typical SSOVs have a maximum closing time of 1 second, though some approved valves may have longer times.

  | Flame detector response time |  
  | ---------------------------- |  
  | Combustion safeguard response time |  
  | Flame failure response time (FFRT) |  
  | SSOV closing time |  
  | 0 Loss of flame Flame signal off Power to SSOV off 5 sec maximum SSOV closed |

  **Figure A.8.10.3**: Response Times on Loss of Flame.

### Burner Arrangements

- **Self-Piloted Burner**  
  The term self-piloted burner is defined in section 3.3.5.14.

- **Single Burner Arrangements**  
  Two examples of burner arrangements considered to be a single burner with one flame safeguard installed at the end of the assembly are shown in Figures A.8.10.6(a) and A.8.10.6(b).

  > [Figure] Example of a Combustion Safeguard Supervising a Group of Radiant Cup Burners Having Reliable Flame-Propagation Characteristics from One to the Other by Means of Flame-Propagation Devices

### Fuel Oil Temperature Considerations

- **Temperature Effects on Fuel Oil**  
  If the temperature of fuel oil drops below a safe level, increased viscosity prevents proper atomization. No. 2 and No. 4 fuel oils can congeal if their temperature falls below their pour point, regardless of preheater use. Conversely, if the temperature rises above a safe level, vaporization occurs before atomization, reducing fuel volume and potentially quenching the flame.

### Standby Fuel Safety

- **Safety Requirements**  
  The fact that oil or gas is considered a standby fuel should not reduce the safety requirements for that fuel.

### A.8.16 Excess Temperature Set Point

The excess temperature set point should be set no higher than the maximum temperature specified by the manufacturer. If flammable or combustible materials are being processed in an oven or a dryer, the set point should be a temperature that will not allow the material to reach its auto-ignition temperature. Set point limits based on auto-ignition temperature do not apply to special-atmosphere furnaces and fume incinerators. If, for process reasons, the work must be protected from reaching an elevated temperature that is lower than the oven excess temperature set point, an additional temperature limit interlock can be used, or the operating temperature controller can be interlocked or alarmed as needed for this purpose.

For a constant speed exhaust fan, as the oven temperature increases, the oven exhaust flow in standard cubic feet per minute decreases. A high temperature excursion reduces safety ventilation and could cause a flammable vapor explosion in ovens and dryers provided with safety ventilation.

### A.8.16.6 Sensor Failures

To detect other sensor failures, such as thermocouple short circuits, that will not result in the action required by 8.16.5, additional measures should be considered.

---

![NFPA logo] 2015 Edition

The operator or maintenance personnel could evaluate the process temperature limit interlock's temperature indication.

### A.8.16.7
Temperature-sensing components, such as thermocouples and extension wires, that are not rated for the environment are at greater risk of short circuits.

### A.8.16.8
The sensing element should be positioned where the difference between the temperature control sensor and the excess temperature limit sensor is minimized. The temperature-sensing element of the excess temperature limit interlock should be located where it will sense the excess temperature condition that will cause the first damage to the furnace or work as temperatures within the furnace rise above the maximum operating set point most critical to safe operation.

### A.8.16.9
The temperature-sensing element of the excess temperature limit interlock can be monitored by other instrumentation, provided that the accuracy of the excess temperature limit interlock temperature reading is not diminished.

### A.8.17.3
Visual indication permits detection of sensor failures, such as thermocouple short circuits, that will not result in the action required by 8.17.2. Operator or maintenance personnel can evaluate the 1400°F (760°C) bypass interlock by observing the temperature indication. It is also acceptable to bring the 1400°F (760°C) bypass interlock thermocouple output into a PLC or another instrument in parallel with the 1400°F (760°C) bypass interlock, providing the accuracy of the 1400°F (760°C) bypass interlock is not diminished. The PLC or other instrument can be used to monitor, trend, and alarm the 1400°F (760°C) bypass interlock thermocouple output by comparing its output with that of an independent temperature measurement, such as from the operating temperature interlock.

For a constant speed exhaust fan, as the oven temperature increases, the oven exhaust flow in standard cubic feet per minute decreases. A high temperature excursion reduces safety ventilation and could cause a flammable vapor explosion in ovens and dryers provided with safety ventilation.

### A.8.18.1.5
The requirements of 8.18.1.5 could require the derating of some components as listed by the manufacturers for uses such as for other types of industrial service, motor control, and as shown in Table A.8.18.1.5.

### A.8.18.2
The excess temperature set point should be set no higher than the maximum temperature specified by the manufacturer. If flammable or combustible materials are being processed in an oven or a dryer, the set point should be a temperature that will not allow the material to reach its auto-ignition temperature. Set point limits based on auto-ignition temperature do not apply to special-atmosphere furnaces and fume incinerators. If, for process reasons, the work must be protected from reaching an elevated temperature that is lower than the oven excess temperature set point, an additional temperature limit interlock can be used, or the operating temperature controller can be interlocked or alarmed as needed for this purpose.

#### System Faults
1. System fault (short circuit) not cleared by normally provided branch-circuit protection (see **NFPA 70, National Electrical Code**).
2. Excess temperature in a portion of the furnace that has not been abated by normal temperature-controlling devices.
3. Failure of any normal operating controls where such failure can contribute to unsafe conditions.
4. Loss of electric power that can contribute to unsafe conditions.

## A.8.17.4 Temperature-Sensing Components

Temperature-sensing components, such as thermocouple and extension wires, that are not rated for the environment are at greater risk of short circuits.

## A.8.17.8 Auxiliary Contact in Excess Temperature Limit Interlock

An auxiliary contact in the excess temperature limit interlock device can be used as a 1400°F (760°C) bypass interlock, providing the requirements of 8.17.2 are satisfied.

## A.8.18.1.1 Abnormal Conditions

Abnormal conditions that could occur and require automatic or manual de-energization of affected circuits are as follows:

### Table A.8.18.1.5 Heater Ratings

| 150-600 amperes                        | 111 | 90 | 125 | 80 |

*Note: Table applies to maximum load or open ratings for safety switches, circuit breakers, and industrial controls approved under current National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standards.*

## A.8.18.2.5 Detecting Sensor Failures

To detect other sensor failures, such as thermocouple short circuits, that will not result in the action required by 8.18.2.4, the operator or maintenance personnel could evaluate the excess temperature limit interlock's temperature indication.

## A.8.18.2.6 Temperature-Sensing Components

Temperature-sensing components, such as thermocouple and extension wires, that are not rated for the environment are at greater risk of short circuits.

## A.8.18.2.7 Positioning of Sensing Element

The sensing element should be positioned where the difference between the temperature control sensor and the excess temperature limit sensor is minimized. The temperature-sensing element of the excess temperature limit interlock should be located where it will sense the excess temperature condition that will cause the first damage to the furnace or work as temperatures within the furnace rise above the maximum operating set point most critical to safe operation.

# A.8.18.2.8 Temperature-Sensing Element

The temperature-sensing element of the excess temperature limit interlock can be monitored by other instrumentation, provided that the accuracy of the excess temperature limit interlock temperature reading is not diminished.

# A.8.19 Excess Temperature Set Point

The excess temperature set point should be set no higher than the maximum temperature specified by the manufacturer. If flammable or combustible materials are being processed in an oven or a dryer, the set point should be a temperature that will not allow the material to reach its auto-ignition temperature. Set point limits based on auto-ignition temperature do not apply to special-atmosphere furnaces and fume incinerators. If, for process reasons, the work must be protected from reaching an elevated temperature that is lower than the oven excess temperature set point, an additional temperature limit interlock can be used, or the operating temperature controller can be interlocked or alarmed as needed for this purpose.

For a constant speed exhaust fan, as the oven temperature increases, the oven exhaust flow in standard cubic feet per minute decreases. A high temperature excursion reduces safety ventilation and could cause a flammable vapor explosion in ovens and dryers provided with safety ventilation.

## A.8.19.2 Interrupting Heat Transfer Fluid Flow

Interrupting the flow of heat transfer fluid to an oven can be accomplished by shutting down the central fluid heating system or by shutting a heat transfer fluid safety shut-off valve on both the oven supply and the return lines. If heat transfer fluid safety shutoff valves are used, the central fluid heating system might need an automatic emergency loop to provide a dummy cooling load and to maintain fluid flow through the heater.

## A.8.19.6 Detecting Sensor Failures

To detect other sensor failures, such as thermocouple short circuits, that will not result in the action required by 8.19.5, the operator or maintenance personnel can evaluate the excess temperature limit interlock's temperature indication.

## A.8.19.7 Temperature-Sensing Components

Temperature-sensing components, such as thermocouple and extension wires, that are not rated for the environment are at greater risk of short circuits.

## A.8.19.8 Positioning the Sensing Element

The sensing element should be positioned where the difference between the temperature control sensor and the excess temperature limit sensor is minimized. The temperature-sensing element of the excess temperature limit interlock should be located where it will sense the excess temperature condition that will cause the first damage to the furnace or work as temperatures within the furnace rise above the maximum operating set point most critical to safe operation.

## A.8.19.9 Monitoring the Temperature-Sensing Element

The temperature-sensing element of the excess temperature limit interlock may be monitored by other instrumentation, providing that accuracy of the excess temperature limit interlock temperature reading is not diminished.

# A.9.1 Protection Needs of Ovens and Furnaces

This standard addresses the protection needs of ovens, furnaces, and related equipment. Fire protection needs external to this equipment are beyond the scope of this standard.

Fixed fire protection for the equipment can consist of sprinklers, water spray, carbon dioxide, foam, dry chemical, water mist, or steam extinguishing systems. The extent of protection required depends upon the construction and arrangement of the oven, furnace, or related equipment as well as the materials being processed. Fixed protection should extend as far as necessary in the enclosure and ductwork if combustible material is processed or combustible buildup is likely to occur. If the fixtures or racks are combustible or are subject to loading with excess combustible finishing materials, or if an appreciable amount of combustible drippings from finishing materials accumulates in the oven or ductwork, protection should also be provided.

Steam inerting systems can be used to protect ovens where steam flooding is the only means available. Otherwise, the use of steam in ovens is not recommended.

# Fire Safety Guidelines for Flammable Gas and Liquid Handling

Hydrogen and other flammable gas fires are not normally extinguished until the supply of gas has been shut off because of the danger of re-ignition or explosion. Personnel should be cautioned that hydrogen flames are invisible and do not radiate heat. In the event of fire, large quantities of water should be sprayed on adjacent equipment to cool the equipment and prevent its involvement in the fire. Combination fog and solid stream nozzles should be used to allow the widest adaptability in fire control.

Small flammable gas fires can be extinguished by dry chemical extinguishers or with carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or steam. Re-ignition can occur if a metal surface adjacent to the flame is not cooled with water or by other means.

Dip tanks and drain boards included in oven enclosures should be protected by an automatic fire suppression system if flammable or combustible liquids are involved. NFPA 34, *Standard for Dipping, Coating, and Printing Processes Using Flammable or Combustible Liquids*, provides guidance for the design of fire suppression systems for dip tanks and drain boards.

## A.9.1.3 Fire Protection and Response

Where fire protection is determined to be necessary, a documented study should be conducted to determine the correct response to a fire to achieve a safe shutdown of the oven and an effective response of the fire protection system. Automatic interlocks should be provided where actions do not require operator evaluation. Specific actions will depend on the oven design, type of fire protection system, the characteristics of the combustible material(s), the source(s) of combustibles, the ability to isolate combustible sources, and the effects of fresh air. Items to be considered should include, but not be limited to, the following:

1. The means for detecting a fire
2. Type(s) of fire protection system(s) effective at controlling the fire
3. Manual vs. automatic operation of the fire protection system
4. Shutting down the fuel supply (heating system) where such action does not increase the fire hazard
5. Stopping the conveyor system vs. diverting or stopping entering product and running the conveyor at high speed to empty the oven
6. Shutting down fans and closing dampers to block fresh air entry and contain the fire suppression medium vs. maintaining fans in operation and dampers open to ensure an explosive atmosphere does not develop

## A.9.2 Steam Extinguishing Systems

Where steam extinguishing systems are provided, they should be designed in accordance with fire protection engineering principles.

### A.9.2.1 Automatic Sprinkler Protection

Automatic sprinkler protection should be considered for ovens, furnaces, or related equipment if any of the following conditions exist:

1. The material being processed is combustible.
2. Racks, trays, spacers, or containers are combustible.
3. There are areas where appreciable accumulations of combustible drippings or deposits are present on the inside of the oven surface or on racks, trays, and so forth.

The type of sprinklers and their arrangement should be appropriate to the oven arrangement, interior ductwork, and the material passing through the oven.

### A.9.2.3 Water Spray Systems for Quench Tanks

Where a water spray system is protecting a quench tank, the fixed-temperature actuation devices for the water spray system should be rated at least one temperature rating lower than the temperature rating of the building sprinklers over the quench tanks.

### A.9.2.4 Carbon Dioxide Systems for Quench Tanks

Where a carbon dioxide system is protecting a quench tank, the fixed-temperature actuation devices for the carbon dioxide system should be rated at least one temperature rating lower than the temperature rating of the building sprinklers over the quench tanks.

# Document on Fire Suppression and Incineration Systems

## A.9.2.6 Dry Chemical Systems for Quench Tanks

Where a dry chemical system is protecting a quench tank, the fixed-temperature actuation devices for the dry chemical system should be rated at least one temperature rating lower than the temperature rating of the building sprinklers over the quench tanks.

## A.9.3.2 Galvanizing and Elevated Temperatures

At elevated temperatures, galvanizing can flake off pipe surfaces, and the flakes can collect at and obstruct the discharge of the fire suppression system.

## A.10.2.1 Afterburner or Fume Incinerator Systems

Afterburner or fume incinerator systems might or might not employ catalysts or various heat exchange devices to reduce fuel usage. Structural supports, thermal expansion joints, protective insulation for incinerator housings, stacks, related ductwork, and heat recovery systems utilizing incinerator exhaust gases should be designed for operating temperatures of 450°F to 2000°F (232°C to 1093°C).

## A.10.2.3 Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer Design

A regenerative thermal oxidizer design can maximize efficiency by maintaining a minimum volatile concentration in the airstream. To achieve this efficiency even when the VOC source concentration varies, some designs inject a flammable vapor into the airstream immediately upstream of the oxidizer. The rate of injection may be controlled by temperature feedback or a similar method. Care is needed to ensure that the following conditions are met:

1. The concentration of volatiles cannot exceed 25 percent LFL (50 percent LFL with flammable vapor concentration controller).
2. The gas injection piping is isolated during purge (proved closed).
3. The gas injection is interlocked with the burner management system (flame failure).

When operating temperatures are below 1400°F (760°C), a 1400°F (760°C) bypass interlock cannot be implemented in accordance with Section 8.17.

## A.10.6.1 Thermal Oxidizers Requirements

Requirements for thermal oxidizers are located in Chapter 10.

## A.10.6.2 Fume Incinerators

Fume incinerators should operate at the temperature necessary for the oxidation process and in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. Fume incinerators or afterburners should control atmospheric hydrocarbon emissions by direct thermal oxidation, generally in the range of 1200°F to 2000°F (650°C to 1093°C). Figure A.10.6.2 shows a solvent fume incinerator with heat recovery.

- **T/C high temp. limit switch**
- **Oven Single- or multiple-pass heat exchanger**

**FIGURE A.10.6.2** Example of a Direct Thermal Oxidation Incinerator (Afterburner) with Primary Heat Recovery.

## A.10.6.2.1 Hazards from Multiple Fume Sources

An individual fume source or multiple sources that feed into one fume incinerator might cause additional hazards if fed into an operating incinerator during the purge cycle of the source. (See 8.5.1.3.)

## A.10.6.2.2 Operating Controls for Fume Incinerators

Operating controls should be configured to minimize the likelihood of an excess temperature condition being caused by one or more of the following:

1. Reduction or termination of fuel to the fume incinerator burner
2. Interruption of the fume-generating process
3. Dilution of hydrocarbon concentration with fresh air
4. Partial emission stream bypass of the heat exchanger

### A.10.6.3.3 Exhaust Recycling and Safety

When exhaust is recycled, it can reduce the oxygen content supplied to the incinerator, thereby reducing destruction efficiency. This, in turn, results in increased levels of flammable vapors being exhausted into the oven for heat recovery purposes. The system design should have inherent physical characteristics to ensure that the ratio of heat recovery gases is limited to prevent unsafe conditions. Alternatively, a combination of telemetry controls and interlocks should be used to prevent this from occurring.

### A.10.6.4 Catalytic Fume Incinerators

Catalytic fume incinerators should operate at the temperature necessary for the catalytic oxidation process in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. These incinerators control atmospheric hydrocarbon emissions by thermal oxidation, using a catalyst element. Oxidation occurs at or near the auto-ignition temperature of the contaminants, which ranges from 450°F to 950°F (232°C to 510°C).

Catalyst elements utilize various types and forms of substrates such as:

1. Metal shavings
2. Small, irregular metal castings
3. Formed or stamped light-gauge sheet metal
4. Ceramic or porcelain-formed structures, pellets, or granules

Most substrates are restricted to fixed bed applications, although pellets and granules have applications in fluidized beds as well. Various catalyst materials are available, including rare earth elements, precious metals such as platinum and palladium, and a few metallic salts. For commercial use, the catalyst material is bonded to or mixed in with the substrates specified in the preceding list.

For atmospheric pollution control, catalyst materials are frequently installed in oven exhaust streams. The increased energy level resulting from hydrocarbon oxidation is either discharged to the outside atmosphere or recycled to the process oven, directly or by means of a heat exchange system.

The application of catalysts should recognize the inherent limitations associated with these materials, such as the inability to oxidize silicone, sulfur, and halogenated compounds. Certain catalysts employing base metals (e.g., manganese and copper) are resistant to halogens and sulfur poisons. Metallic vapors such as tin, lead, and zinc can destroy catalyst activity, whereas various inorganic particulates (dust) can mask the catalyst elements and retard activity, necessitating specific maintenance procedures. Consultation with qualified suppliers and equipment manufacturers is recommended prior to installation.

Where applicable, catalyst afterburner exhaust gases can be utilized as a heat source for the process oven generating the vapors or some other unrelated process. Heat recovery can be indirect, by the use of heat exchange devices, or direct, by the introduction of the exhaust gases into the process oven.

Alternatively, catalytic heaters can be installed in the oven exhaust stream to release heat from evaporated oven by-products, with available energy being returned by means of heat exchange and recirculation to the oven processing zone.

> **Figure A.10.6.4(a)**: Example of Catalyst System Independent of Oven Heater for Air Pollution Control. The diagram includes labels such as Odor-free exhaust, Catalyst, Fan, Preheat burner, Paint finishing oven, Work entrance, Burner, Work exit, Recirculation fan, Fresh air intake, and Oven heater, along with temperature indications 600°F, 500°F, and 400°F. Arrows indicate the direction of airflow within the system.

### A.10.6.4.2 Temperature Monitoring and Control

The temperature differential across the catalyst should be monitored to ensure that catalytic oxidation is occurring. Separate temperature-indicating instruments or controllers can be used to determine this arithmetically. Control of fuel or electrical energy for preheating the fume stream entering the catalyst can utilize temperature-measuring instruments at the catalyst inlet or discharge or at a juncture between instruments in each location. Maximum permitted afterburner temperature should be monitored only at the catalyst bed exit. The value of the temperature across the catalyst bed indicates the energy release and should be limited to values non-destructive to the catalyst material.

> **Figure A.10.6.4(b):** Example of Indirect-Type Catalytic Oven Heater for Full Air Pollution Control. The diagram features components such as the Work entrance, Starting burner, Catalyst bed, Catalytic heater, Exhaust fan, Work exit, Recirculation fan, and Fresh air intake, depicting their arrangement within the system.

Regenerative catalyst oxidizers that employ flow reversal through the system do not produce a measurable temperature across the catalyst bed indicative of the energy released from the oxidation of the combustibles. In regenerative catalytic oxidation systems, the flow is reversed frequently through the system to maximize utilization of process heat. One characteristic is that the measured temperature at any one point in the system's packed beds, whether in the heat matrix (ceramic packing) or in the catalyst bed, is never constant; rather, it is a sinusoidal function of time. Measuring before and after the catalyst bed does not show energy released from volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation. The fact that the catalyst bed is employed for VOC oxidation and heat recovery means that those temperatures measured are dependent on flow rate, duration between flow reversals, concentration of VOC, VOC species, activity of catalyst, and burner input.

### A.10.6.4.3 High-Temperature Shutdown and Cooling

Concentrations at 25 percent LFL can produce a temperature rise near 600°F (316°C) that, when added to the required inlet temperature, results in temperatures generally considered to be within a range where thermal degradation occurs.

In the event of a high-temperature shutdown of the system, the catalyst bed will need to be cooled to prevent further damage to the catalyst through thermal or high-temperature breakdown. Most catalysts employ a high surface area substrate, such as alumina, that allows for the maximum amount of catalyst material exposed to the fumes per unit of catalyst (pellet, granule, or structured packing). The surface area of the catalyst can be diminished through failure of the pore structure of the substrate at elevated temperatures [typically greater than 1200°F (649°C)], which results in less exposed catalyst material per unit of catalyst and a lower activity. This rate of thermal poisoning is a function of temperature and duration, and the net effect can be minimized by quickly cooling the catalyst to safe operating temperatures, from 450°F to 950°F (232°C to 510°C).

### A.10.6.4.4 Oxidation Performance

Oxidation performance of catalyst material is a function of temperature, velocity, and pressure drop through the bed, with bed size and configuration directly related to these factors. Pressure drop across the bed fluctuates with temperatures and particulate contamination. Contamination can lead to reduced safety ventilation in the upstream process.

### A.10.6.4.5 Catalyst Definition and Reality

Although the definition of a catalyst is a substance that participates in a chemical reaction without being changed by it, the reality is that catalysts are affected by chemical reactions over time.

# Annex A

Catalytic reactions, over time, will lose their ability to promote the desired chemical reaction. To ensure that a catalytic fume incinerator is performing as intended, it is necessary to periodically check the activity of the catalyst. The usual method is to send a sample of the catalyst to the supplier for testing. The need for obtaining samples should be addressed in the design of the catalyst bed.

The consequence of declining catalyst activity is the incomplete destruction of the organic vapor. Among the products of a partial combustion reaction are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and aldehydes, all of which are flammable. The impact of significant quantities of these flammable gases on the operation of a direct heat recovery system should be assessed by the equipment supplier. Other potential concerns include the odor and skin irritation that can be caused by the aldehydes.

## A.11.4.4

See Section 7.6 regarding oven entry procedure and asphyxiation warnings.

## A.11.6.1.4

Chemical properties can be obtained from the manufacturer's literature, published literature, or the tables in A.11.6.8.4.

# NFPA Guidelines on Ovens and Furnaces

## A.11.6.1.7 Propeller-Type Fans or Blowers

The use of propeller-type fans or blowers with forward-curved blades for applications involving vapors that are not clean should be reviewed due to their susceptibility to accumulation of deposits and possible loss of safety ventilation.

## A.11.6.1.10 Dual-Purpose Fan Installations

In the past, NFPA 86 prohibited ovens using a single fan for both recirculation and exhaust. These dual-purpose fan installations have a long history of fire and explosion incidents. The primary cause of these incidents was short-circuiting of safety ventilation, resulting in pockets or zones where flammable vapors can concentrate.

The current text for 11.6.1.10 now permits alternative means to dedicated exhaust fans for proving safety ventilation. Accordingly, the user, oven designer, and the AHJ are cautioned to carefully examine airflow of both incoming and exhaust with respect to operating pressures, circulating methodology, and proof of the airflow design.

Figure A.11.6.1.10 illustrates an example that is unacceptable because short-circuiting is possible, as well as an example that is potentially acceptable. The key in most cases is locating the fresh air intake(s) in relation to the exhaust appropriately to ensure that fresh air passes throughout the volume.

These drawings best pertain to batch ovens, as the openings in a continuous oven alter pressure differentials, creating additional flow paths which must be taken into consideration.

## A.11.6.1.16 Ventilation for Volatile Solvents

The vapors of most volatile solvents and thinners commonly used in finishing materials are heavier than air; consequently, bottom ventilation is of prime importance (see the tables in A.11.6.8.4). Liquefied petroleum gases are heavier than air, and other fuel gases are lighter than air. See NFPA 325, Fire-Hazard Properties of Flammable Liquids, Gases, and Volatile Solids. (Note: Although NFPA 325 has been officially withdrawn from the National Fire Codes, the information is still available in NFPA's Fire Protection Guide to Hazardous Materials.)

In areas outside the oven where volatiles are given off by material prior to entering the oven, adequate provisions should be made to exhaust vapors to the atmosphere in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal regulations.

## A.11.6.2.1 Reference

See A.8.6.1.

## Ventilation System Examples

### Unacceptable Example

Note that the fresh air passes through the heater and out the exhaust without recirculating, allowing localized concentrations in excess of 25% LFL.

> [Figure] Illustration showing an 'Unacceptable Example' of an oven and furnace ventilation system. The system features a heater and airflow indicated by dotted arrows. Concentration levels of 25% LFL, 43% LFL, and 25% LFL are marked at various points.

### Potentially Acceptable Example

Note that the recirculation and flow path forces the fresh air into the oven to travel throughout the volume and mix with the oven atmosphere before exiting via the exhaust. Other features, such as proving airflow through the exhaust, are required.

> [Figure] Illustration showing a 'Potentially Acceptable Example' of an oven and furnace ventilation system. The system includes a heater and airflow indicated by dotted arrows. Concentration levels of 15% LFL, 25% LFL, and 25% LFL are marked at different points.

## A.11.6.3.1 Equipment Installation

The installation of any equipment can increase the pressure drop of the system and therefore reduce the combustion airflow, exhaust flow, or safety ventilation.

## A.11.6.5 Minimum Safety Ventilation

The processes of determining the minimum safety ventilation for continuous ovens and for batch ovens are shown in Figure A.11.6.5(a) and Figure A.11.6.5(b).

# Annex A: Safety Ventilation Calculation Method

## A.11.6.5.1 Temperature and Altitude Corrections

### Example in U.S. Customary Units
To draw 9200 ft³/min of fresh air referred to 70°F (530°R) into an oven operating at 300°F (760°R), it is necessary to exhaust 13,200 actual ft³/min of heated air.

### Example in SI Units
To draw 260 m³/min of fresh air referred to 21°C (294 K) into an oven operating at 149°C (422 K), it is necessary to exhaust 374 actual m³/min of heated air.

All volumes and volumetric flow values should indicate temperature and pressure conditions (e.g., 100 ft³/min at 300°F (2.83 m³/min at 148.9°C) and ambient pressure). [0°F (-18°C) is equivalent to 460°R (256 K).] [See Table 11.6.5.1(B)]

### A.11.6.5.2 Altitude Correction Factor

## Annex A

### A.11.6.7 Volatile Content in Oven Cure Cycle

When the actual percent of volatile content released during the oven cure cycle is not known, 9 percent has been found to be a conservative estimate in most instances. The further requirement to treat the released volatile mixture as if it were xylene provides an additional safety factor, because xylene has one of the highest ventilation rate requirements of commonly used solvents in paint coating and curing processes.

#### Solvent Rate for Powder Curing Ovens

1. **Calculate the Weight (W) of Powder Entering the Oven:**

   \[
   W = \frac{S \times T}{C}
   \]

   - **W**: Maximum rate of powder delivered into oven [lb (kg)/hr or lb (kg)/batch]
   - **S**: Surface area of parts to be coated [ft²/hr (m²/hr)]
   - **T**: Maximum powder coating thickness [mil (mm)]
   - **C**: Manufacturer's recommended coverage in area per weight powder for specified thickness

     *Typically, 1 lb of powder covers 135 ft² to a thickness of 0.001 in. (1 mil), and 1 kg of powder covers 0.70 m² to a thickness of 1 mm.*

2. **Calculate the Amount (G) of Solvent Entering the Oven:**

   \[
   G = \frac{R \times W}{\text{lb (kg)/gal (L) of solvent}}
   \]

   - **G**: Amount of solvent entering the oven per hour or per batch [gal (L)]
   - **R**: Percentage of powder constituents released during oven cure cycle. An accepted value for a typical powder and operating condition is 9 percent by weight, based on experimental determination. Thus, 0.09 lb or 0.09 kg of flammable constituents is released per pound or per kilogram of powder cured.

     *An alternative method for determining the percentage of volatile content can be found in the Powder Coating Institute publication "Recommended Practice for Determination of Volatile Content of Powder Coating Materials."*

   - **W**: Maximum rate of powder delivered into oven, as determined in (1) [lb (kg)/hr or lb (kg)/batch]

Use the value calculated for **G** in subsequent calculations for continuous and batch process ovens per 11.6.8 and 11.6.9, respectively.

# A.11.6.8 Explanatory Materials and Methods for Calculating Ventilation in Various Types of Ovens

The air delivered into an oven by the supply system to do the necessary work can be all fresh air (from a source outside the oven), or it can be partly fresh air and partly recirculated air from within the oven. Only the fresh air supplied provides safety ventilation, and the amount of fresh air supplied must be equivalent to the amount of oven exhaust air, to keep the system pressure in balance. The amount of air discharged from the oven by the exhaust system is a fair indication of the safety ventilation, provided the supply and exhaust systems are designed properly. The minimum amount of fresh air delivered into the oven for safety ventilation is established by the amount of solvent vaporized from the work in process. The method for determining the minimum volume of fresh air necessary for safety ventilation is provided in A.11.6.8.4.

## Measurement of Quantity of Air Exhausted from an Oven

A simple method for determining the quantity of air exhausted from an oven is to measure the velocity of air through the discharge duct by means of a velometer, an anemometer, a pitot tube, or other suitable means. This measurement is then used to calculate the volume (cubic feet or cubic meters) of air per minute by multiplying the velocity in lineal feet per minute (lineal meters per minute) by the cross-sectional area of the exhaust duct in square feet (square meters). The temperature of the exhaust air should also be measured, and the calculated volume then corrected to 70°F (21°C). The resultant quantity of air is an indication of the volume exhausted from the oven, provided the exhaust air does not mix with air external to the oven. In many ovens, particularly those of the continuous type, the exhaust ducts have been incorrectly placed in locations that allow outside air to enter the exhaust system together with the ventilation air exhausted from the oven.

### Example

For a continuous oven, determine the parts of exhaust air at 300°F (149°C) and fresh air at 70°F (21°C) that, when mixed, produce a resultant temperature of 242.5°F (117°C), given the following conditions:

1. The temperature reading of mixed air at discharge of the exhaust fan is 242.5°F (117°C).
2. The temperature reading of air in the oven at the exhaust site is 300°F (149°C).
3. The temperature reading of outside air at the entrainment site is 70°F (21°C).

#### U.S. Customary Units

- \( x \) = parts at 300°F
- \( y \) = parts at 70°F

\[ 242.5(x + y) = 300x + 70y \]

\[ 242.5x + 242.5y = 300x + 70y \]

\[ 242.5y = 57.5x \]

\[ 3y = x \]

#### SI Units

- \( x \) = parts at 149°C
- \( y \) = parts at 21°C

\[ 117(x + y) = 149x + 21y \]

\[ 117x + 117y = 149x + 21y \]

\[ 117y = 32x \]

\[ 3y = x \]

Therefore, 3 parts at 300°F (149°C) + 1 part at 70°F (21°C) = 4 parts total at 242.5°F (117°C).

In this example, 75 percent of the air discharged by the exhaust fan is from inside the oven. Correcting this volume for 70°F (21°C) establishes the amount of 70°F (21°C) fresh air admitted into the oven.

In cases where all the fresh air admitted to the oven is through one or more openings where the volume(s) can be measured directly, it is not necessary to perform these calculations.

## A.11.6.8.1

Because a considerable portion of the ventilating air can pass through the oven without traversing the zone in which the majority of vapors are given off, or because uniform ventilation distribution might not exist, the 25 percent concentration level introduces a 4:1 factor of safety.

## A.11.6.8.3

Most LFL values are reported at 77°F (25°C), although several are given at 212°F (100°C). The LFL value decreases at higher temperatures, so it is necessary that the LFL value for a particular solvent be corrected for the operating temperature of the oven.

The formulas used in 11.6.8.3 were originally published in Bureau of Mines Bulletin 627, "Flammability Characteristics of Combustible Gases and Vapors." The temperature correction factor also can be expressed approximately as a 5 percent reduction in the LFL value for each 100°F (37.8°C) rise in temperature above 77°F (25°C).

### A.11.6.8.4 Chemical Properties

Chemical properties can be obtained from manufacturers or from published data. The data in Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b) have been obtained from NFPA 325, *Fire-Hazard Properties of Flammable Liquids, Gases and Volatile Solids*, and material safety data sheets (MSDS) where available. Available figures from numerous sources vary over a wide range in many instances, depending on the purity or grade of samples and on the test conditions prescribed by different observers. (Note: Although NFPA 325 has been officially withdrawn from the National *Fire Codes*, the information is still available in NFPA's *Fire Protection Guide to Hazardous Materials*.)

It is important to obtain precise data on the rate of evaporation by actual tests on particular paint formulations in use. Multiple-component preparations might contain several solvents with widely differing values of LFL, specific gravity, and vapor density. Until such determinations are made, the operation should be on the side of safety. Therefore, the individual solvent whose data result in the largest required volume of air per gallon should be used as the basis for safe ventilation.

#### Sample Problem to Determine Required Ventilation

For a continuous oven, determine the volume of oven dilution air that would render vapor from a known volume of toluene barely flammable, given the following:

1. 1 gal of water weighs 8.328 lb at 70°F; 1 L of water weighs 0.998 kg at 21°C.
2. Dry air at 70°F and 29.9 in. Hg weighs 0.075 lb/ft³; dry air at 21°C and 0.76 m Hg weighs 1.200 kg/m³.
3. 1 m³ = 1000 L = 1000 dm³
4. The specific gravity ($SpGr$) of toluene = 0.87 (water = 1.0).
5. The vapor density ($VD$) of toluene = 3.1 (air = 1.0).
6. The LFL of toluene in air = 1.1 percent by volume [see Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b)] and in the LFL calculations is expressed as 1.1 (not 0.011); this value for the LFL is at standard ambient temperature of 70°F (21°C).
7. The measured oven exhaust temperature ($t$) = 300°F (149°C).
8. The corrected LFL ($LFL_7$) for oven exhaust temperature is as follows (see 11.6.8.3):

   \[
   (LFL)(LFL_{CF}) = 1.1[1-0.000784(149°C-25°C)] = 0.99
   \]

**U.S. Customary Units**

The following calculation is used to determine the cubic feet (ft³) of vapor per gallon (gal) of solvent:

\[
\frac{8.328}{0.075} \frac{SpGr}{VD} = \text{ft³/gal at 70°F}
\]

For this example:

\[
\frac{8.328}{0.075} \left(\frac{0.87}{3.1}\right) = 31.16 \text{ ft³ vapor per gal of toluene at 70°F}
\]

$LFL_7$, being equivalent to 0.99 percent of the cubic feet of air rendered explosive by 1 gal of toluene, is as follows:

\[
31.16 \left(\frac{100-0.99}{0.99}\right) = 3116 \text{ ft³ air at 70°F per gal toluene}
\]

Products of combustion must be added to this volume in accordance with 11.6.6.1 and corrections then made for higher oven exhaust temperature and, if applicable, for elevations of 1000 ft (305 m) or greater. An example of how these additional factors are applied can be found in A.11.6.7.

**SI Units**

The following calculation is used to determine the cubic meters (m³) of vapor per liter (L) of solvent:

\[
\frac{0.998}{1.200} \left(\frac{SpGr}{VD}\right) = \text{m³/L at 21°C}
\]

For this example:

\[
\frac{0.998}{1.200} \left(\frac{0.87}{3.1}\right) = 0.233 \text{ m³ vapor per L of toluene at 21°C}
\]

$LFL_7$, being equivalent to 0.99 percent of the cubic meters of air rendered explosive by 1 L of toluene, is as follows:

\[
0.233 \left(\frac{100-0.99}{0.99}\right) = 23.30 \text{ m³ air at 21°C per L toluene}
\]

Products of combustion must be added to this volume in accordance with 11.6.6.1, and corrections then made for higher oven exhaust temperature and, if applicable, for elevations of 1000 ft (305 m) or greater. An example of how these additional factors are applied can be found in A.11.6.7.

## Another Method of Computation

For this example, xylene is to be used as the solvent, as follows:

1. **The specific gravity ($SpGr$) of xylene** = 0.88 (water = 1.0).
2. **The molecular weight of xylene [$C_6H_4(CH_3)_2$]** = 106.
3. **The LFL of xylene in air** = 0.9 percent by volume [see Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b)].
4. **The corrected LFL ($LFL_7$) for oven exhaust temperature** is as follows (see 11.6.8.3):

   \[
   (LFL) (LFL_{CF}) = 0.9 [1-0.000784 (149°C -25°C)] = 0.81
   \]

5. **The molecular weight in pounds of any gas or vapor occupies 387 ft³ at 70°F and 29.9 in. of mercury.** The molecular weight in grams of any gas or vapor occupies 24.1 L at 21°C and 101 kPa.

### U.S. Customary Units

- **The weight of 1 gal xylene is as follows:**

  \[
  0.88 \left(\frac{8.328 \text{ lb H}_2\text{O}}{\text{gal}}\right) = 7.33 \text{ lb xylene/gal}
  \]

- **The volume of 1 gal xylene, when vaporized, is as follows:**

  \[
  \frac{(7.33 \text{ lb}) (387 \text{ ft}³)}{106 \text{ (molecular weight)}}
  \]

# LFL_T Calculations

**LFL_T**, being equivalent to 0.81 percent of the cubic feet of air rendered explosive by 1 gallon of xylene, is as follows:

\[ 26.76 \left(\frac{100-0.81}{0.81}\right) = 3277 \text{ ft}^3 \text{ air at } 70^\circ \text{F per gallon of xylene} \]  
\[ \text{[A.11.6.8.4j]} \]

Products of combustion must be added to this volume in accordance with 11.6.6.1. Corrections should then be made for higher oven exhaust temperature and, if applicable, for elevations of 1000 ft (305 m) or greater. An example of how these additional factors are applied can be found in A.11.6.7.

**SI Units**: The weight of 1 liter of xylene, when vaporized, is as follows:

\[ \left(\frac{0.998 \text{ kg } H_2O}{L}\right) \left(\frac{1000 \text{ g}}{\text{kg}}\right) (0.88 \text{ SpGr}) = 878 \text{ g xylene/L} \]  
\[ \text{[A.11.6.8.4k]} \]

The volume of 1 liter of xylene, when vaporized, is as follows:

\[ \frac{(878 \text{ g}) (24.1 \text{ L})}{106 \text{ (molecular weight)}} = 200 \text{ L xylene vapor at standard conditions} \]  
\[ \text{[A.11.6.8.4l]} \]

**LFL_T**, being equivalent to 0.81 percent of the cubic meters of air rendered explosive by 1 liter of xylene, is as follows:

\[ 200 \text{ L} \left(\frac{100-0.81}{0.81}\right) \left(\frac{1 \text{ m}^3}{1000 \text{ L}}\right) = 24.49 \text{ m}^3 \text{ air at } 21^\circ \text{C per liter of xylene} \]  
\[ \text{[A.11.6.8.4m]} \]

Products of combustion must be added to this volume in accordance with 11.6.6.1. Corrections should then be made for higher exhaust temperature and, if applicable, for elevations of 1000 ft (305 m) or greater. An example of how these additional factors are applied can be found in A.11.6.7.

This table is designed to provide a quick reference for the properties of various solvents, which can be useful for chemical analysis, safety assessments, and industrial applications.

# Annex A

## A.11.6.8.4(C)

The basis for the general rule is that 1 gallon of typical solvent produces a quantity of flammable vapor that, when diffused in air, forms approximately 2640 scf of a lean mixture that is barely explosive (1 liter of a typical solvent forms approximately 19.75 standard m³ of a lean mixture that is barely explosive). Refer to Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b). The value of 12,000 ft³ (340 m³) includes a factor to account for LFL correction at 350°F (177°C).

## A.11.6.8.5

Caution is needed when determining the maximum allowable gallons per minute of solvent entering the oven. It is not uncommon for designers to propose that only a fraction of the solvent actually enters an oven zone since much of the solvent has already been driven off either in a flash-off booth or in upstream oven zones. Because proof of safety ventilation is based on the measuring of exhaust, contaminated infiltration air from these upstream processes can represent a significant fraction of the air used for safety ventilation, particularly during "upset conditions" in which the oven exhaust and recirculation systems might be imbalanced.

Moreover, many airflow proving devices are not able to prove minimum airflow rates with any accuracy; rather, they prove air movement. Accordingly, assumptions that an exhaust airflow switch proves an exhaust airflow rate sufficient to dilute solvent vapor to 25% LFL must take into account variables introduced by changes in damper settings and the potential for a fraction of infiltration air to be contaminated by flammable vapors.

A general common solution cannot be provided due to the large number of variations in design and operation parameters for oven curing processes.

## A.11.6.9

Following are sample calculations for batch ovens.

**Example 1:** Sample calculations for electrically heated batch oven processes coated metal using approximation method. Dipped product through batch oven operating at 300°F (149°C) at sea level. Volatiles in paint = 3 gallons (11.4 liters) of volatiles (mostly methyl ethyl ketone) per batch into oven.

### U.S. Customary Units

Required ventilation, theoretically not to reach the LFL [see 11.6.9.3 and 11.6.5], is as follows:

\[ (440\ \text{scfm})\left(\frac{3 \ \text{gal}}{\text{batch}}\right)(1.4 \ \text{factor}) = 1848\ \text{scfm air} \]

Correction for oven temperature is as follows:

\[ 1848\left(\frac{300^\circ\text{F} + 460^\circ\text{F}}{70^\circ\text{F} + 460^\circ\text{F}}\right) = 2650\ \text{ft}^3/\text{min of air at } 300^\circ\text{F} \]

### SI Units

Required ventilation, theoretically not to reach the LFL [see 11.6.9.3 and 11.6.5], is as follows:

\[ \left(\frac{3.29\ \text{standard m}^3}{\text{min}}\right)\left(\frac{11.4\ \text{L}}{\text{batch}}\right)(1.4\ \text{factor}) = 52.5\ \text{standard m}^3/\text{min of air} \]

Correction for oven temperature is as follows:

\[ 52.5\left(\frac{149^\circ\text{C} + 273^\circ\text{C}}{21^\circ\text{C} + 273^\circ\text{C}}\right) = 75.3\ \text{m}^3/\text{min of air at } 149^\circ\text{C} \]

## Example 2: Sample Calculations for Electrically Heated Batch Oven Processes

### Ventilation Calculation Using Test Measurements

A batch oven operating at 255°F (124°C) at sea level is used for curing transformer coils impregnated with a coating containing 4.8 gal (18.2 L) of volatiles, mostly toluene. Tests under operating conditions indicate that over 5 hours are needed to evaporate all volatiles, with the peak evaporation rate occurring in the first 5 minutes after loading at a rate of 0.06 gal/min (0.227 L/min). The calculated ventilation rate, including a temperature correction factor for LFL for batch ovens [see 11.6.9.2 and 11.6.5], is as follows:

### U.S. Customary Units

Barely flammable mixture at peak evaporation rate [see Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b)]:

\[ \left(\frac{2800\ \text{scf air}}{\text{gal toluene}}\right)\left(\frac{0.06\ \text{gal}}{\text{min}}\right) = 168\ \text{scfm mixture at LEL} \]

Safety ventilation calculation:

\[ 168\ \text{scfm} \times 4\ (\text{factor of safety}) \times 1.4\ (\text{LFL temperature adjustment}) = 941\ \text{scfm of air} \]

Correction for oven temperature:

\[ \left(941\ \text{scfm}\right)\left(\frac{255^\circ\text{F} + 460^\circ\text{F}}{70^\circ\text{F} + 460^\circ\text{F}}\right) = 1269\ \text{ft}^3/\text{min of air at } 255^\circ\text{F} \]

### SI Units

Barely flammable mixture at peak evaporation rate [see Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b)]:

\[ \left(\frac{21.04\ \text{standard m}^3\ \text{air}}{\text{L toluene}}\right)\left(\frac{0.227\ \text{L}}{\text{min}}\right) = 4.78\ \text{standard m}^3\ \text{mixture/min at LEL} \]

Safety ventilation calculation:

\[ \frac{4.78\ \text{m}^3}{\text{min}}\times 4(\text{factor of safety}) \times 1.4\ (\text{LFL temperature adjustment}) = 26.77\ \text{standard m}^3/\text{min} \]

Correction for oven temperature:

\[ \left(\frac{26.77\ \text{standard m}^3}{\text{min}}\right)\left(\frac{124^\circ\text{C} + 273^\circ\text{C}}{21^\circ\text{C} + 273^\circ\text{C}}\right) = 36.15\ \text{m}^3/\text{min of air at } 124^\circ\text{C} \]

## Example 3: Sample Calculations for Electrically Heated Batch Oven Processes

### Known Solvent Volume

A batch oven cures a load of fiber rings impregnated with thinned asphalt at 480°F (249°C), with volatiles being mostly Mineral Spirits No. 10. From weight tests of samples removed throughout the cure, it was established that the maximum amount of volatiles evaporated in any 1-hour period is 2.3 gal (8.7 L), and the total weight loss throughout the cure is equivalent to 6.6 gal (25.0 L). The installation is at sea level. The estimated ventilation required is in 11.6.9.2.

### U.S. Customary Units

Barely flammable mixture of Mineral Spirits No. 10 [see Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b)]:

\[ \left(\frac{2836\ \text{ft}^3\ \text{mixture}}{\text{gal M.S. No.10}}\right)\left(\frac{2.3\ \text{gal}}{\text{hr}}\right) = 6523\ \text{scf/hr mixture at LFL} \]

Calculated ventilation volume:

\[ 6523\ \text{scfm} \times \frac{10}{60} \times 1.4\ (\text{LFL temp. adjustment}) = 1522\ \text{scfm of air} \]

Correction for oven temperature:

\[ \left(1522\ \text{scfm}\right)\left(\frac{480^\circ\text{F} + 460^\circ\text{F}}{70^\circ\text{F} + 460^\circ\text{F}}\right) = 2699\ \text{ft}^3/\text{min of air at } 480^\circ\text{F} \]

### SI Units

Barely flammable mixture of Mineral Spirits No. 10 [see Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b)]:

\[ \left(\frac{21.21\ \text{m}^3\ \text{mixture}}{\text{L M.S. No. 10}}\right)\left(\frac{8.7\ \text{L}}{\text{hr}}\right) = 184.5\ \text{standard m}^3/\text{hr mixture at LFL} \]

Calculated ventilation volume is as follows:

# Ventilation and Temperature Correction in Ovens

## Calculation of Air Flow

To adjust for the lower flammable limit (LFL) temperature, the air flow is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{184.5 \, \text{m}^3/\text{hr} \times \frac{10}{60} \times 1.4}{}
\]

This results in:

\[
= 43.1 \, \text{standard m}^3/\text{min of air}
\]

### Correction for Oven Temperature

The correction for oven temperature is calculated using the formula:

\[
\left(\frac{43.1 \, \text{standard m}^3/\text{hr}}{}\right)\left(\frac{249°C + 273°C}{21°C + 273°C}\right)
\]

This results in:

\[
= 76.21 \, \text{m}^3/\text{min of air at 249°C}
\]

## Considerations for Ventilation

### A.11.6.9.1 Factors to Consider

There are numerous factors to consider, including:

- The initial solvent load when the batch oven is charged at the initial and operating temperatures over time.
- The ventilation rate.
- The effect of temperature on the solvent LFL.
- The altitude.

The calculation and estimation methods provided in this standard have been found by empirical test data and successful operation over time to prevent concentrations over LFL. No calculation method can account for unpredicted upset conditions or improper operation.

### A.11.6.9.3 Industrial Experience

Industrial experience indicates that the nature of the work being cured is the main factor in determining the safety ventilation rate. Different types of work produce different rates of evaporation, and field tests show that sheet metal or parts coated by dipping generally produce the highest evaporation rates. Tests and years of experience have shown that 440 scfm of air per gallon (3.29 standard m³/min of air per liter) of flammable volatiles is reasonably safe for dipped metal.

### A.11.6.9.3(B)(2) Explanatory Materials and Methods

**Explanatory Materials and Methods for Calculating Ventilation in Various Types of Ovens**

The air delivered into an oven by the supply system to do the necessary work can be all fresh air (from a source outside the oven), or it can be partly fresh air and partly recirculated air from within the oven. Only the fresh air supplied provides safety ventilation, and the amount of fresh air supplied must be equivalent to the amount of oven exhaust air, to keep the system pressure in balance. The amount of air discharged from the oven by the exhaust system is a fair indication of the safety ventilation, provided the supply system and the exhaust system are designed properly. The minimum amount of fresh air delivered into the oven for safety ventilation is established by the amount of solvent vaporized from the work in process. The method for determining the minimum volume of fresh air necessary for safety ventilation is provided in A.11.6.7.

**Measurement of Quantity of Air Exhausted from an Oven**

A simple method of determining the quantity of air exhausted from an oven is to measure the velocity of air through the discharge duct by means of a velometer, an anemometer, a pitot tube, or other suitable means. This measurement is then used to calculate the volume (cubic feet or cubic meters) of air per minute by multiplying the velocity in lineal feet per minute (lineal meters per minute) by the cross-sectional area of the exhaust duct in square feet (square meters). The temperature of the exhaust air also should be measured and the calculated volume then corrected to 70°F (21°C). The resultant quantity of air is an indication of the volume exhausted from the oven, provided the exhaust air does not mix with air external to the oven. In many ovens, particularly those of the continuous type, the exhaust ducts have been incorrectly placed in locations that allow outside air to enter the exhaust system together with the ventilation air exhausted from the oven.

## Example Calculation

For a continuous oven, determine the parts of exhaust air at 300°F (149°C) and fresh air at 70°F (21°C) that, when mixed, produce a resultant temperature of 242.5°F (117°C), given the following conditions:

1. The temperature reading of mixed air at discharge of the exhaust fan is 242.5°F (117°C).
2. The temperature reading of air in oven at exhaust site is 300°F (149°C).
3. The temperature reading of outside air at the entrainment site is 70°F (21°C).

### U.S. Customary Units

Let:
- \( x \) = parts at 300°F
- \( y \) = parts at 70°F

The equation is:

\[
242.5(x + y) = 300x + 70y
\]

Simplifying:

\[
242.5x + 242.5y = 300x + 70y
\]

\[
172.5y = 57.5x
\]

\[
3y = x
\]

# SI Units

- **x** = parts at 149°C  
- **y** = parts at 21°C  

\[ 117 (x + y) = 149x + 21y \]  
\[ 117x + 117y = 149x + 21y \]  
\[ 96y = 32x \]  
\[ 3y = x \]  

Therefore, 3 parts at 300°F (149°C) + 1 part at 70°F (21°C) = 4 parts total at 242.5°F (117°C).

In this example, 75 percent of the air discharged by the exhaust fan is from inside the oven. Correcting this volume for 70°F (21°C) establishes the amount of 70°F (21°C) fresh air admitted into the oven.

In cases where all the fresh air admitted to the oven is through one or more openings where the volume(s) can be measured directly, it is not necessary to perform these calculations.

## A.11.6.9.4

Extensive tests have been conducted by Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (Bulletin of Research No. 43, "The Lower Limit of Flammability and the Autogenous Ignition Temperature of Certain Common Solvent Vapors Encountered in Ovens") to obtain data regarding the effect of elevated temperatures on the LFL of many of the solvents commonly used in connection with ovens. These tests show that the LFL of all solvents tested decreases as the temperature increases, leading to the conclusion that more air [referred to 70°F (21°C)] is required for safety per gallon (liter) of solvent as the oven temperature increases. The actual figures vary considerably with different solvents.

## A.11.6.10.2

In many operations, the continuous vapor concentration high limit controller could be required to respond to an upset condition in less than 5 seconds to detect transient upsets. This response requires the controller to be located close to the sampling point to minimize transport time and generally precludes the use of one controller sequentially sampling multiple points.

## A.11.6.10.3

Figure A.11.6.10.3(a), Figure A.11.6.10.3(b), and Figure A.11.6.10.3(c) provide examples of heating zones. To show that a given process line will not exceed 25 percent LFL requires detailed knowledge, modeling, and testing of the process.

## A.11.7.1.2

Low-oxygen ovens, also called inert ovens, operate safely at a much higher concentration of solvent vapor by limiting the oxygen concentration. Oxygen concentration within the appropriate equipment is kept low by the addition of an inert gas. (See Figure A.11.7.1.2.)

# Solvent and Vapor Safety Guidelines

## A.11.7.2 Solvent Vapors

Solvent vapors are not flammable below a certain oxygen concentration, which is different for each solvent. See the table in A.11.7.10(5) for the flammability of many solvents and the figure in A.11.7.12(1) for the flammable region for two common solvents.

### A.11.7.2.2 Solvent Storage System

A solvent storage system might include a condenser system, pumps, filters, tanks, level controls, and distillation equipment.

> **Figure**: This figure shows two heating zones with a common exhaust fan setup. This system includes "Product", which is entering the zone. Several arrows indicate the direction of movement. The presence of "T" is also marked.

## A.11.6.10.4 Vapor Concentration Control

When a continuous vapor concentration controller is used to modulate the flow of fresh air into or exhaust from an oven, there is a possibility that a malfunction of the controller will lead to a hazardous situation. For that reason, another protection system is required. The simplest form of backup is a fixed damper stop that is set so that the oven solvent concentration cannot exceed 50 percent LFL for the highest design solvent input rate. The disadvantage of the fixed damper stop is that it limits the ability of the controls to reduce the dilution air when the solvent input is low. Increased flexibility is the main advantage of using a separate continuous vapor concentration high limit controller as the system backup.

## A.11.6.10.9 Safety Sequence

The sequence might include opening the exhaust and fresh air dampers, shutting down heaters, stopping the conveyor or web, stopping the coating process, and stopping or removing the coating material.

## A.11.7.4(3) Ventilation

Ventilation should be provided at the oven openings to capture any escaping solvent vapors.

## A.11.7.5 Storage Compliance

All storage tanks and compressed gas cylinders should comply with local, state, and federal codes and applicable NFPA standards relating to the types of fluids stored, their pressures, and their temperatures.

## A.11.7.6.6 Flow-Limiting Devices

A flow-limiting device such as a critical flow-metering orifice, sized to limit the flow at the maximum inlet pressure, can fulfill this requirement.

## A.11.7.7.1 Flow Rate Variation

The flow rate can be varied during the course of the process cycle.

## A.11.7.8.3 Carbon Steel Pipe

Commercial-grade carbon steel pipe exhibits a marked reduction in impact strength when cooled to subzero temperatures. Consequently, it is vulnerable to impact fracture if located downstream of a vaporizer running beyond its rated vaporization capacity or at very low ambient temperature.

## A.11.7.9.1 Safety System Core

The core of the safety system is the reliable monitoring of oxygen on a continuous basis, with shutdown if the oxygen level becomes too high.

## A.11.7.9.3 Personnel Safety

Personnel should be provided with independent analyses of solvent and oxygen concentration before entry. (See Chapter 7 and Annex B.)

The installation of any equipment can increase the pressure drop of the system and therefore reduce the flow rate.

#### A.13.5.2
The combustion reaction is self-supporting and gives off heat (i.e., it is exothermic). The usual combustion range is from 60 percent to 100 percent of the stoichiometric ratio (aeration). In exothermic generators, the combustion products become the atmosphere gas; therefore, the gaseous constituents supplied to exothermic generators are called *fuel gas* and *air*.

#### A.13.5.2.1
Cuprous acetylide \((Cu_2C_2)\) is formed by exposure of acetylene to copper in an alkaline aqueous environment. When the water is removed and the cuprous acetylide is dried out, a minor impact or frictional force will cause a violent, explosive reaction.

Acetylene is produced in small quantities in the exothermic gas-generating process. Water is a by-product of the exothermic atmosphere-generating process, and in many designs, water is used to directly cool the gas. The water can be alkaline due to many chemical influences internal or external to the gas-generating equipment.

#### A.13.5.3
Subsection 13.5.3 applies to those generators that require the addition of heat to complete the reaction of the gas and air generating the atmosphere and in which the atmosphere being generated is separated at all times from the heating combustion products or other heating medium.

The separation of atmosphere is effected by the use of retorts, tubes, pipes, or other special vessels. To simplify this standard, all gas used in the reaction with air to create the atmosphere is called *reaction gas*, and all air used in this reaction is called *reaction air*. Gas burned with air to supply heat is called *fuel gas*, and all air used with the fuel gas is called *combustion air*. The atmosphere produced in the generator from heating the mixture of reaction gas and reaction air is called *special atmosphere gas*. The reaction gas and the fuel gas might or might not be the same type of gas.

![figure of heptane and acetone graph]

Note: To purge from any operating point on the 8 percent oxygen operating line, purge with inert gas to reach the solvent concentration at C (LOC), then purge with air. This avoids passing through the flammability region by a comfortable margin.

# Purging Requirements and System Design Considerations

## Figure A.11.7.12(1): Example of Purging Requirements

This figure shows two graphs demonstrating the purging requirements for acetone and heptane. Both graphs plot %O2 on the y-axis (ranging from 0 to 20) against % Acetone or % Heptane on the x-axis (ranging from 0 to 100). Each graph includes lines representing the Lower Flammable Limit (LFL), Upper Flammable Limit (UFL), and Limiting Oxygen Concentration (LOC), as well as air and inert purge lines. The flammable region is indicated on each graph.

- **Acetone Purging Requirements**: 
  - LFL (A) = 2.5%
  - UFL (B) = 12.8%
  - LOC (C) = 11.5% oxygen and 3.8% (est.) acetone

- **Heptane Purging Requirements**: 
  - LFL (A) = 1.05%
  - UFL (B) = 6.7%
  - LOC (C) = 11.5% oxygen and 1.8% (est.) heptane

## A.13.5.3.5 System Design Considerations

Certain system designs can require additional approved protective equipment to the reaction section, and the following components should be considered:

1. Flowmeters
2. Meters or pressure gauges on the reaction gas and reaction air supplies

## A.13.5.4 Ammonia Dissociation Generators

Subsection 13.5.4 applies to those types of generators in which ammonia is dissociated into hydrogen and nitrogen by the action of heat and is separated at all times from the heating combustion products or other heating medium.

### A.13.5.4.2(A) Additional Protective Equipment

Certain system designs can require additional approved protective equipment, and the following components should be considered:

1. Flow indicators
2. Meters
3. Pressure gauges on reaction gas

## A.13.5.5 Vaporizers for Safety Purging

Vaporizers used for safety purging to convert cryogenic liquids to the gas state should be ambient air heat transfer units so that flow from such vaporizers is unaffected by the loss of power.

The use of powered vaporizers is permitted where one of the following conditions is satisfied:

1. The vaporizer has reserve heating capacity to continue vaporizing at least five furnace volumes at the required purge flow rate immediately following power interruption.
2. Reserve ambient vaporizers are provided that are piped to the source of supply so that they are unaffected by a freeze-up or flow stoppage of gas from the powered vaporizer. The reserve vaporizers should be capable of evaporating at least five furnace volumes at the required purge flow rate.
3. Purge gas is available from an alternative source that is capable of supplying five volume changes after interruption of the flow of the atmosphere gas to the furnace.

Vaporizers should be rated by the industrial gas supplier or the owner to vaporize at 150 percent of the highest purge gas demand for all connected equipment. Winter temperature extremes for the locale should be taken into consideration by the agency responsible for rating the vaporizers.

The industrial gas supplier should be informed of additions to the plant that materially increase the inert gas consumption rate so that vaporizer and storage capacity can be resized for the revised requirements.

A temperature indicator should be installed in the vaporizer outlet piping for use in evaluating its evaporation performance at any time.

A device should be installed that prevents the flow rate of gas from exceeding the vaporizer capacity and thereby threatening the integrity of downstream equipment or control devices due to exposure to cryogenic fluids. A break in the downstream pipeline or failure (opening) of the supply pressure regulator could cause excessive flow. Exceeding the capacity of an atmospheric vaporizer leads to a gradual decrease in gas temperature that can be remedied by decreasing the demand on the vaporizer.

In atmospheric vaporizers, in lieu of the flow-limiting device, a visual and audible alarm should indicate to operators in the vicinity of the furnace that the temperature of the vaporizer outlet gas has fallen below a minimum level, indicating a potential to exceed vaporizer capacity.

## Gas Atmosphere Mixing Systems

### A.13.5.6

Gas atmosphere mixing systems are used to create special processing atmospheres made up of two or more gases. The majority are built to create binary nitrogen-hydrogen blends, but they also can create mixtures of other gases. The blended gas of gas atmosphere mixing systems usually has a constant flammable or indeterminate composition and is supplied on a pressure or demand basis to the special processing atmosphere flow controls situated at one or more furnaces.

Gas atmosphere mixing systems typically incorporate a surge tank mixing scheme that cycles between set pressure limits. This feature distinguishes them from the flow control systems covered in 13.5.7.

#### A.13.5.6(1)

Consideration should be given to the inclusion of filters or strainers to improve reliable functioning of pressure regulators, flowmeters, flow monitors, control valves, and other components.

The object of this requirement is to prevent infiltration of air that could be detrimental to the work being processed or could result in the creation of flammable gas-air mixtures within the furnace. The flow rates can be varied during the course of a heat treatment cycle.

### A.13.5.7.3

After closure of an outer vestibule door of a batch-type furnace or a pusher furnace, a delay usually occurs before burn-off resumes at the vent opening. The duration of the delay depends on the special atmosphere flow rate, its combustibles content, the vestibule volume, and other factors.

### A.13.5.7.4(B)

The indication of flow is intended to be provided by a device that will indicate flow any time a flow is occurring, including during a power outage. A mechanical device that indicates the flow rate without using any source of power except the physical flow of the inert purge gas meets this requirement. The uncertainty of a reliable backup power supply, such as backup batteries or an uninterruptible power supply, during a primary power interruption precludes the use of "electronic" monitoring of flow.

## Atmosphere Expansion and Infiltration

### A.13.5.8.3

Inadequate dissociation results in lessened atmosphere expansion, which causes a reduction in furnace pressure and thereby creates an air infiltration hazard.

Insufficient temperature also can create a condition in which unvolatized atmosphere fluid is carried into the quench tank, changing the physical characteristics of the quench oil, such as increasing the vapor pressure and lowering the flash point.

### A.13.5.8.11

Filters or strainers should be provided to ensure reliable functioning of pressure regulators, flowmeters, flow monitors, control valves, and other components.

### A.13.5.8.12(1)

Paragraph 13.5.8.12(1) addresses excess flow in the equipment piping for an individual furnace. This involves a device at the special atmosphere control panel, such as an electronic sensor, along with logic to close an automatic shutoff valve upon detection of excess flow. Paragraph 13.5.8.12(1) does not preclude operational high flow set points at thresholds below the shutoff excess flow set point. The operational high flow set points can be provided to initiate alarms that prompt operator intervention to restore appropriate flow levels before the shutoff excess flow level is reached.

## Special Atmosphere Definitions

### A.13.5.10

Refer to the definitions for special atmosphere in 3.3.67.

# A.13.5.11.1 Furnace Pressure and Safety

## A.13.5.11.1(B) Positive Pressure Maintenance

Failure to maintain positive pressure in a furnace can allow air infiltration. Air infiltration can occur at effluents, open ends, or the perimeter of doors. Additionally, welds in a furnace shell can break, gasketed joints can fail, and radiant tube heaters can be breached, all of which could introduce additional sources of air infiltration. Furnaces should be designed to minimize sources of air infiltration. Furthermore, furnace shell joints and radiant tube heaters should be periodically evaluated or tested and repaired as needed. Should positive furnace pressure be lost in furnaces or chambers operating below 1400°F (760°C), air infiltration can lead to a flammable gas-air mixture that can result in an explosion. Loss of positive furnace pressure can be caused by an inadequate flow of carrier gases or loss of furnace heat, and loss of furnace heat will lead to the thermal contraction of the atmosphere volume.

## A.13.5.11.1(C) Flame Character Recognition

The character of the flame at furnace open ends and special atmosphere effluents will be a function of the specific furnace. It is essential for the furnace operator to be trained to recognize the "established character" of these flames. In addition, the operator should be aware of the typical timing for flame to appear at open ends and effluent vents.

## A.13.5.11.1(D) Bubbler Functionality

The fluid in a bubbler can be water or oil. Bubblers might be provided to protect a furnace from overpressure or to maintain a minimum positive atmosphere pressure within the furnace. Bubblers also can control pressure within a bell furnace using an oil seal. Overpressure of the retort or work chamber could blow the oil out of the seal ring. It is also possible to have water condensation accumulate in a bubbler bottle that can add to the liquid level and allow an increase in furnace pressure, which could increase furnace pressure to excessive levels and lead to the loss of oil seals.

## A.13.5.11.1(E) Effluent Release Hazards

Where flammable atmosphere effluent is released unburned to the interior of a building, the accumulation of flammable gases could create a fire or explosion hazard. To avoid this hazard, effluent that will not reliably ignite upon contact with air should be captured by a hood and discharged to a safe outside location. See also A.6.2.6.3, which addresses additional hazards.

## A.13.5.11.1(F) Prohibition of Plant Air Use

The use of plant air with reducing regulators is prohibited. Plant air lines can become slugged with water passing into the heated furnace resulting in abnormally high furnace pressures. Plant air lines can experience regulator failures resulting in high-pressure air admission into a furnace that contains a flammable atmosphere.

# A.13.5.11.2 Ignition Sources and Safety

## A.13.5.11.2(B) Burn-off Pilots

Burn-off pilots using full premix (fuel-gas mixed with all the air needed to support full combustion) and glow plugs are examples of ignition sources meeting the intent of A.13.5.11.2(B). Full premix burn-off pilots have sufficient air (or, more precisely, sufficient oxygen in air) premixed with the fuel gas to maintain the burn-off pilot if the purge gas or special atmosphere gas otherwise creates an oxygen-deficient atmosphere that would not support the burning of the burn-off pilot flame.

## A.13.5.11.2(C) Monitoring Pilot Flames

Where loss of ignition of vent effluent creates either an environmental or a personal safety concern, the pilot flame should be monitored and an alarm generated to alert the operator to loss of flame.

## A.13.5.11.2(E) Emergency Door Operation

The ability to open doors manually in emergency situations is needed. Upon the simultaneous loss of furnace atmosphere and door pilot supervision, there will be a need to purge or manually open doors to burn-out vestibules that use an alternative source of ignition.

# Annex A: Burn-Off Pilots and Furnace Safety

## A.13.5.11.2(G) Flame Supervision for Burn-Off Pilots

If burn-off pilots were equipped with flame supervision interlocked to turn fuel gas off to the burn-off pilot upon loss of flame, the burn-off pilots would also be turned off in the event of a power failure. The loss of burn-off pilots at special atmosphere effluent points during a power failure is undesirable and would create a serious safety concern with reliably maintaining ignition of effluents. Where flame supervision is provided, it is for an alarm to draw attention to the need to relight the burn-off pilot or it is interlocked to prevent the opening of a furnace door.

## A.13.5.11.2(H) Location of Burn-Off Pilots

Burn-off pilots should be located where they will contact the effluent stream. For example, for a lighter-than-air effluent flowing from a furnace open end, the effluent most likely will be encountered at the top of the opening.

## A.13.5.11.2(J) Interruption of Burn-Off Pilots

Burn-off pilots are not to be interrupted by any action other than closing of their individual manual shutoff valve or closing of the main equipment manual shutoff valve.

## A.13.5.11.3 Door Interlocks

Regarding items (2) and (5), once a door begins to open, it is intended that the door will be permitted to open completely. The interlock is only intended to prevent a closed door from opening.

### A.13.5.11.3(6) Manual Override

The manual override is provided for abnormal conditions to permit the manual removal of special atmospheres from the furnace.

## A.13.5.11.6.1(A) Purge Effectiveness

Purge effectiveness can be compromised by actions such as operating furnace doors, operating quench elevators, introducing work, and operating fans not included in the purge process. Purge effectiveness can also be compromised by not running fans required to effect the purge. Avoiding such actions can be accomplished by written operating procedures or interlocks.

## A.13.5.11.6.4 Verification of Safety Shutoff Valves

Verification of flammable special atmosphere safety shutoff valves being closed can be accomplished by operator observation.

## A.13.5.11.6.7 Atmosphere-Air Interfaces

Flammable atmosphere-air interfaces occur at doors, open ends, effluents, and other locations where the flammable atmosphere contacts air. Active sources of ignition include door burn-off pilots, flame curtains, manual torches, door effluents above 1400°F (760°C), glow plugs, and hot door parts above 1400°F (760°C). Atmosphere-air interfaces can be avoided by a nitrogen seal.

Where a furnace has open ends or doors, a flame of established character appearing at open ends or atmosphere effluents indicates that the atmosphere introduction has been completed or is being maintained.

Furnaces without open ends or doors, such as bell furnaces and strip processing furnaces with sealed entrance and exit, might not have ignited effluent lines. As such, the operator might not know if or when the flammable atmosphere introduction is complete; however, because the furnace is sealed and positive pressure is maintained, this is not a safety concern. The operator is not using the effluent flame as an indicator for determining when to cycle loads or operate doors.

The character of the flame at furnace open ends and special atmosphere effluents is a function of the specific furnace. It is essential that the furnace operator be trained to recognize the "established character" of these flames.

## A.13.5.11.6.8 Furnace Volume

The furnace volume includes chambers, zones, covers, and retorts that contain the flammable special atmosphere within the furnace. Ductwork associated with recirculating fans such as jet coolers are considered part of the furnace volume, as are features such as large door housings or chambers and large pusher chain or mechanism housings that are exposed to the flammable special atmosphere.

# A.13.5.11.6.11

(4) Oil level directly affects the volume of the vestibule. Flammable special atmosphere introduction should not begin without quench oil being at the appropriate level. Atmosphere introduction should not be interrupted once started.

# A.13.5.11.6.12

The character of the flame at furnace open ends and special atmosphere effluents will be a function of the specific furnace. It is essential that the furnace operator be trained to recognize the "established character" of these flames. In addition, the operator should be aware of the typical timing for flame to appear at open ends and effluent vents. Furnaces, such as heating-cover types, that have no open ends, doors, or effluent lines will have no features to provide indicators of visible flame. This is an acceptable arrangement and is addressed by the specific furnace design and operating instructions.

# A.13.5.11.7.1

**(A)** Burn-in effectiveness can be compromised by actions that are not included in the burn-in operating instructions. Furnace doors, quench elevators, and fans should not be operated except in accordance with written burn-in operating instructions. Work should not be introduced into a furnace during the burn-in process. Burn-in effectiveness can also be compromised by running or not running fans in accordance with written burn-in instructions.

# A.13.5.11.7.2

The burn-in process is anticipated to reduce the oxygen level within the furnace to a point at or below 1 percent as the oxygen in air is consumed by the burn-in process.

# A.13.5.11.7.3

Any flammable atmosphere gas introduced into a chamber at or above 1400°F (760°C) will be reliably ignited by auto-ignition. An alternative method of atmosphere gas ignition, beyond just the burning flame front, might be needed where the burning atmosphere gas enters chambers below 1400°F (760°C).

# A.13.5.11.7.4

Long cooling tunnels can extinguish the burning atmosphere flame front by cooling the atmosphere gas as it moves along the length of the tunnel.

# A.13.5.11.7.5

In some furnace designs, such as the Type II furnace (integral quench batch furnace), manual torches might be needed as a means to reliably ignite flammable atmosphere gas as it flows into the cool vestibule chamber from the hot heating chamber. Written burn-in instructions for the specific furnace will outline the specific sequence to follow for burn-in. The following burn-in procedure for a Type II furnace is provided as one example:

1. Atmosphere gas is introduced into the hot heating chamber and auto-ignites. Ignition is visually verified, and the inner heating chamber door is closed.

2. A port in the closed inner door allows the atmosphere gas to flow from the heating chamber to the vestibule chamber. A manual torch placed at this port ignites the atmosphere gas.

3. Once ignition is visually verified at the inner door port, the manual torch is removed and the outer vestibule door is closed, and the vestibule is allowed to burn-in.

4. Burn-in of the vestibule is visually confirmed once a steady flame appears at the vestibule atmosphere effluent vent.

# A.13.5.11.7.6

To avoid adverse effects on the special atmosphere in the heat zone and vestibule, the heating chamber fan is turned off when the inner door is open. One adverse effect could be the creation of atmosphere flow in the vestibule, that could draw in air around the steel-to-steel contact between the vestibule door and the furnace shell. Also, during initial furnace burn-in, the operator typically will be instructed to visually verify ignition of the special atmosphere gas as it is introduced to the heating chamber. That requires both the heating chamber door and the vestibule door to be open and the heating chamber fan to be off to allow visual observation.

# A.13.5.11.7.7

During burn-in, cooling zone fans are to be turned off to avoid disrupting the flame front burning.

## OVENS AND FURNACES

Through the cooling chamber, if a furnace is being heated, the heat zone fans typically need to be kept in service to avoid thermal damage. In a cooling chamber, the only ignition source is the flame front, which is easily disrupted by fan circulation. In a heating chamber above 1400°F (760°C), the entire environment is an ignition source, and fans will not adversely affect the reliability of ignition.

### A.13.5.11.7.8

- **(B)** The retort or inner cover of a Type VIII furnace and the cover of a Type IX furnace will be sealed to the base. Sand seals, oil seals, or rubber seals can be used.
- **(C)** The means to maintain furnace pressure below the static head pressure of the seal oil include the use of bubblers or manometers on vent lines. Other means may be possible. Also see A.13.5.11.1 (E).

### A.13.5.11.7.10

The character of the flame at furnace open ends and special atmosphere effluents will be a function of the specific furnace. It is essential that the furnace operator be trained to recognize the "established character" of these flames. In addition, the operator should be aware of the typical timing for flame to appear at open ends and effluent vents. Furnaces, such as heating-cover types, that have no open ends, doors, or effluent lines will have no features to provide indicators of visible flame. This is an acceptable arrangement and is addressed by the specific furnace design and operating instructions.

### A.13.5.11.8.1

- **(A)** Purge effectiveness can be compromised by actions such as operating furnace doors, operating quench elevators, introducing work, and operating fans not included in the purge process. Purge effectiveness can also be compromised by not running the fans required to effect the purge. Avoiding such actions should be addressed by written operating procedures or by interlocks.

### A.13.5.11.8.3

Oxidizing special atmosphere gases include air.

### A.13.5.11.8.4

The furnace volume includes chambers, zones, covers, and retorts that contain the flammable special atmosphere within the furnace. Ductwork associated with recirculating fans such as jet coolers is considered part of the furnace volume, as is the space in the furnace steel shell but above the refractory arch if flammable special atmosphere gas can permeate into that space. Flammable special atmosphere gases such as hydrogen may migrate into an above-arch space during operation and may require special purging facilities to remove them during the purge-out process.

### A.13.5.11.8.5

Chambers include heating chamber, cooling chambers, vestibules, door housings, and other atmosphere-containing volumes that would create a hazard if not specifically purged.

### A.13.5.11.9.1

- **(A)** Burn-out effectiveness can be compromised by actions that are not included in the burn-out operating instructions. Furnace doors, quench elevators, and fans should not be operated except in accordance with written burn-out operating instructions. Work should not be introduced into a furnace during the burn-out process. Burn-out effectiveness can also be compromised by not running fans required to effect the burn-out.
- **(B)** Typically, where doors are present, the burnout procedure will begin with all inner and outer doors closed. The outermost chamber will be burned-out first.

# Burn-Out Procedures for Furnaces

## A.13.5.11.9.2 Burn-Out Process

Burn-out can be accomplished by introducing air through various means, including open ends, vents, opening doors, header and feed pipes of burnout manifold systems, process air piping, and so forth. Uncontrolled admission of air can lead to excessive temperatures in some furnaces. Opening doors can create a draft through a furnace that can push ignited atmosphere out other openings, and instructions should be carefully developed to avoid such conditions. The written procedures required in 13.5.11.9.1 should provide step-by-step instructions for a controlled burn-out. With hot furnaces that contain soot, it is possible to re-form a flammable atmosphere that may require additional air introduction procedures to effect final burn-out.

## A.13.5.11.9.3 Type IX Furnaces (Cover)

For Type IX furnaces, visual observation of burn-out is not possible until the cover is removed. Written burn-out procedures will typically include the following actions:

1. Release the mechanical clamping devices holding the heating cover to the base.
2. Ignite the manual burn-off pilots or torches and place them in position at the heating cover to the base seal to ignite flammable gases that might be present inside the cover as the seal is broken.

### A.13.5.11.9.3(2)(a) Positive Pressure Requirement

The requirement for the furnace to be under positive pressure is to eliminate the concern that an indeterminate atmosphere might develop in furnace chambers under 1400°F (760°C). With some furnace burn-out procedures (e.g., opening doors), initiating the burn-out can cause the furnace pressure to immediately fall to atmospheric pressure. This is not an issue once the burn-out procedure has been initiated.

## A.13.5.11.9.6 Fan Operation During Burn-Out

During burn-out, fans are to be turned off to avoid disrupting the flame front burning back through to the special atmosphere gas source.

## A.13.5.11.10 Secondary Equipment Isolation

### A.13.5.11.10.2.1 Isolation Means

One of the following secondary equipment isolation means should be provided immediately downstream of the equipment isolation manual shutoff valve so that no leakage of gas passing the equipment isolation manual shutoff valve can enter the downstream special atmosphere piping:

- Removable spool piece
- Breakable flanges with loosely inserted blinding plate
- Blinding plate secured between flanges
- A second valve with venting of the intermediate space between this valve and the special atmosphere manual isolation valve

Two manual shutoff valves in series without venting of the intermediate space would not be considered equivalent to the above choices.

### A.13.5.11.10.3 Vent Line Sizing

Vent line sizing in accordance with 13.5.11.10.3 is intended to avoid the operation of individual devices from affecting (cross-impulsing) other manifolded devices under normal operations. Under upset conditions in which a device diaphragm fails, the vent line will direct the release gas to a suitable location, but it would not necessarily avoid adverse control impact upon other manifolded devices. It should be noted that special atmosphere gases typically operate at low pressure and utilize regulators with large diaphragms that are more sensitive to pressure pulses across interconnected vent lines.

**Figure A.13.5.11.10**: Examples of Special Atmosphere Equipment Piping.

## A.13.5.11.10.4

**(A)** Typically, relief valves would not be provided for generated special atmosphere gases. Relief valves might not be needed for enriching gas where the fuel gas supply to the furnace is equipped with multiple pressure regulators and where the failure of any one pressure regulator would not introduce excessive pressures to the special atmosphere system downstream of the failed pressure regulator. Relief valves might be needed for liquid special atmospheres or special atmosphere gases provided from pressurized storage vessels.

**(B)** Overpressurization of the liquid special atmosphere piping can occur if liquid is isolated in the piping between closed valves and exposed to an increase in temperature. Closed valves can include manual valves, automatic valves, or safety shutoff valves. Other means of controlling pressure could include an accumulator or an expansion tank.

**(C)** See A.6.2.6.3. Also, for atmosphere gases supplied in the liquid state, relief valves can be piped back to the liquid storage vessel.

## A.13.5.11.10.8

Atmosphere impingement on the temperature control thermocouple can result in overheating of the furnace or erroneous control readings on the over-temperature thermocouple.

## A.13.5.11.11.8

The means can be either electrical or mechanical. Mechanical means would include the operation of valves in the special atmosphere piping. For some applications, additional manual action might be required to bring the process to a safe condition.

## A.13.5.11.11.10

**(A)** The removal of flammable special atmospheres by burn-out, purge-out, or emergency purge-out can be caused by manual or automatic action. Table A.13.5.11.11.10(A) summarizes when the action should be automatic and when it can be automatic or manual.

### Table A.13.5.11.11.10(A): Burnout, Purge-out, and Emergency Purge-out Conditions and Responses

| Part | Condition | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Normal furnace atmosphere burn-out initiated | Automatic or manual |
| 2 | Normal furnace atmosphere purge-out initiated | Automatic or manual |
| 3 | Low flow of carrier gas that will not maintain a positive pressure in chambers below 1400°F (760°C) and positive pressure is not restored by the automatic transfer to another source of gas | Automatic |
| 4 | A furnace temperature below which any liquid carrier gas used will not reliably dissociate | Automatic |
| 5 | Automatic emergency inert gas purge initiated | Automatic |
| 6 | Manual operator emergency inert gas purge initiated | Automatic |

Part 3 addresses the condition where there is a low flow of carrier gas that will not maintain positive pressure within a chamber that is below 1400°F (760°C). If a chamber is above 1400°F (760°C), the low flow condition might allow furnace pressure to drop and might allow air infiltration; however, while this might lead to process issues, it is not a safety issue requiring the removal of the special atmosphere. Following operating instructions, the operator can work to restore normal process conditions.

It should be noted that Part 3 does not involve any measurement of the actual furnace pressure. Rather, it is based on comparing the actual carrier gas(es) flow with minimum allowable design flow rates. The actual carrier gas flow is measured with flow sensors. Furnace pressure is subject to fluctuation due to actions such as operating doors and loading or unloading work. The inadvertent shutdown of carrier gases due to a routine furnace pressure fluctuation is considered more of a potential safety hazard than the actual pressure fluctuation itself.

### A.13.5.11.11.11(B)

Where exothermic generated special atmosphere gases are used for purging, the flammable content of the gas is maintained at a limited level that, when mixed with air, would not exceed 25 percent of LFL and therefore would not need a safety shutoff valve. See 13.5.5.1 (D) (2) for further guidance on monitoring of purge gases for flammable components.

### A.13.5.11.11.11(E)

See A.7.4.9.

### A.13.5.11.11.12(D)

Normal shutdown of a furnace by burnout is an example of a practice that causes a furnace chamber to lose positive pressure. However, this loss of positive pressure takes place along with the controlled introduction of air to effect the burnout of the flammable atmosphere. Safety shutoff valves are to close in response to this action, but there is no safety issue with this intended case of furnace pressure loss.

The unintended interruption of a furnace heating system, unintended loss of furnace temperature, unintended reduction of carrier gas flow, or unintended interruption of power are examples of conditions that can cause furnace chambers to lose positive pressure. These conditions, however, can lead to the uncontrolled infiltration of air into furnace chambers, which could rapidly lead to an unsafe condition (faster than operators might be able to respond) in some or all of the chambers. Chamber temperature will influence whether an unsafe condition can develop.

Where chamber temperature is at or above 1400°F (760°C), the uncontrolled air infiltration could create process quality issues; however, it is not anticipated to create safety issues. This standard has no requirement to initiate the removal of the special atmosphere in this case. Instead, the operator should follow written operating instructions and work to restore normal process conditions. The written operating instructions could include directions to implement a controlled furnace shutdown if certain specified conditions develop.

Where chamber temperature is below 1400°F (760°C), the uncontrolled air infiltration could create an explosion hazard. Under these conditions, the safety shutoff valves for flammable special atmospheres will close, and the actions specified in 13.5.11.11.10(B) (1) should automatically occur.

Regarding A.13.5.11.11.12(D) (4), where a carrier gas generated by liquid dissociation is used, furnace temperatures need to be maintained above a temperature that will maintain reliable dissociation of the liquid. In earlier editions of NFPA 86, the minimum temperature was stated as 800°F (427°C). This specific value has been removed from the standard because there is more than one liquid used as a special atmosphere, and each liquid should be evaluated for the minimum temperature that will reliably dissociate that liquid in the furnace. Where a reliable dissociation temperature is not maintained, the special atmosphere liquid might no longer maintain a positive furnace pressure. Once positive furnace pressure is lost, air infiltration will be possible, and a furnace explosion hazard can develop.

### A.13.5.11.11.15

Vestibule explosion relief means usually consist of doors that remain in position under their own weight but are otherwise unrestrained from moving away from the door opening if an overpressure occurs within the furnace.

# A.13.5.11.11.16 Special Atmosphere Gases

Noncarrier special atmosphere gases can be flammable (e.g., enriching gas) or nonflammable (e.g., process air). Their introduction into the furnace should occur only after the carrier gases flow has been established. According to this standard, flammable special atmosphere gases are equipped with safety shutoff valves. Nonflammable special atmosphere gases typically are equipped with solenoid valves.

# A.13.5.12 Purge Effectiveness

The following paragraphs provide additional information with regard to purge effectiveness.

## Verifying Purge Effectiveness by Gas Analysis

Historically, gas analyses have been required to verify when a purge has satisfactorily diluted the oxygen or combustible gas inside a furnace. Accordingly, gas analyzing instruments are included among the protective equipment required to operate furnaces that employ flammable processing atmospheres. Verification is needed because of concerns about the efficacy of a purge due to the following:

1. Difficulties in purging all parts of a furnace
2. Purge not actually flowing into a furnace as intended
3. Air leakage into a furnace through faulty seals around openings
4. Air leaks into the purge gas piping
5. Unreliable flow rate or timing measurements

Gas analysis has been the accepted method for verifying the effectiveness of a purge. Usually, it is a measurement of oxygen or combustible gas concentration in the gas being exhausted from the furnace. Purge effluent gases from furnaces often contain condensed oil and water vapors, soot, and lubricant decomposition products. These materials can clog or accumulate inside sample collection tubing and cause misleading analysis results. They can foul or damage instrument sensors. Consequently, most analyses are manual spot checks made by an operator using portable instruments.

Manual analyses do not lend themselves to modern, automated atmosphere control systems. Instead, instruments that continuously analyze sample streams are preferred. Unfortunately, they suffer from the sample conditioning problems mentioned and often do not provide the reliability needed.

## Timed Flow Purge Method

Measured dilution purging is also a dependable method for accomplishing a successful purge. Because its results are certain and accurately predictable, its effectiveness does not need to be verified by using gas analyzers, provided that the equipment, the purge gas, and the operating procedures are not altered when future purges are performed. Therefore, a standardized timed flow rate measurement can be relied on to perform without resorting to repetitive gas analyses during routine operations of the furnace.

## Dilution Purging

In dilution purging, the diluent gas is added continuously to a furnace or vessel to lower the concentration of the component to be purged. The vent stream is also continuous. For example, air or the oxygen portion of air is purged out of a furnace using an oxygen-free purge gas. The greater the volume of purge gas used in relation to the volume of the purged vessel, the lower the resultant oxygen content. In most cases, the final oxygen concentration is independent of purge time duration. Rather, it is a function of the volume of the container and the total volume of nitrogen introduced.

## Determining Gas Purge Requirements

Figure A.13.5.12 illustrates how the concentration of oxygen in an air-filled furnace drops as nitrogen is introduced (note vertical scale on the right beginning at 20.9 percent oxygen in air). Five furnace volume changes reduce the oxygen content to about 0.1 percent volume.

The vertical scale on the left of Figure A.13.5.12 can be used to predict how much nitrogen is needed to lower the concentration of combustible gases below desired limits. For example, to decrease the hydrogen content of a 10 percent H₂ gas mixture to less than 0.1 percent, five furnace volume changes are needed (seven volume changes minus two volume changes on the horizontal scale).

### Limitations of Dilution Purging Technique

It is important to note that the dilution purge technique depends on uniform mixing of the atmosphere in the furnace or vessel during the purge period. This technique is not predictable if the gas circulation fans fail or if they are incapable of creating a homogeneous mixture throughout the furnace at the diluent flow rate used. Therefore, the time needed to conduct a dilution purge of a given furnace installation can be influenced by the purge gas flow rate. In a furnace equipped with a low capacity circulation fan, the purge gas flow rate might have to be limited to ensure that the diluent gas is dispersed effectively throughout the purged chamber as the purge proceeds. This is not likely to be a problem, provided the diluent flow rate is not radically higher than the normal atmosphere flow rate.

> **Figure A.13.5.12**: The figure shows a graph illustrating the concentration of the original atmosphere remaining in the chamber as a function of volume changes. The X-axis represents volume changes, and the Y-axis represents the concentration of the original atmosphere (%). The graph shows an exponentially decreasing trend, indicating that as the number of volume changes increases, the concentration of the original atmosphere remaining in the chamber decreases.

### Troubleshooting Faulty Purge Trials

If a dilution purging trial fails to duplicate the theoretical result predicted by Figure A.13.5.12, it is a sign that one or more of the following conditions exist:

1. The gas flow or time measurement is faulty.
2. The purge gas is contaminated with the gas being purged.
3. The purge gas supplying the piping or the furnace has leaks and is aspirating air into the system.
4. The atmosphere circulation within the furnace is inadequate.
5. The purge gas is not flowing through the furnace.
6. The gas analysis is faulty.

Inert gas purges are used for either of the following purposes:

1. To remove oxygen (contained in air) from a furnace before introducing a flammable or indeterminate carrier gas.
2. To remove a flammable or indeterminate atmosphere from the furnace before it is opened to the air.

Such purges are required to avoid creating explosive atmosphere-air mixtures inside the furnace when combustible gases are introduced or withdrawn or when a furnace is opened to the air.

#### A.13.5.12.1

Because purging without atmosphere circulation can leave pockets of combustible gases inside a furnace, the presence of a flammable gas might not be detectable by analyzing the vent gas. Further, timed flow purging is not reliable for determining when an inert purge is complete.

#### A.13.5.12.3

Examples of alterations that could reduce purge effectiveness include the following:

1. Revised atmosphere inlet or vent piping
2. Changes or replacements of atmosphere flow controls and metering equipment
3. Revised operating procedures
4. Changes to the furnace, atmosphere gas, or atmosphere process

## A.13.5.13.1(A) Insulated Baffle

The inner door serves as an insulated baffle to block heat loss to the quench vestibule.

## A.13.5.13.3 Elevator Function

The elevator's function is to immerse the work charge in the quench medium with minimum splashing. At the termination of the timed quench cycle, the elevator is raised to the drain position at hearth level.

## A.13.5.13.5 Quench Tank Protection

### A.13.5.13.5(A) Smaller Tanks

Smaller quench tanks also should be so protected, where practical.

The maximum oil level is indicated on the right side of the tank. There are labels indicating a measurement of six inches or 152 mm.

## A.13.5.13.6 Cooling Systems

Quench medium tanks generally utilize a cooling system that maintains the quench medium at an operating temperature that reduces the quantity of quench medium required. Three basic cooling systems are in general use and consist of the following:

1. **Internal Cooler**: A heat transfer medium is circulated through a heat exchanger within the quench tank.
2. **External Cooler (Liquid-Cooled)**: A quench medium is withdrawn from a quench tank, circulated through a liquid-cooled heat exchanger, and returned.
3. **External Cooler (Air-Cooled)**: A quench medium is withdrawn from a quench tank, circulated through an air-cooled heat exchanger, and returned.

## A.13.5.13.7 Quench Oil Water Content

Quench oil should be checked for water content wherever there is a possibility of water intrusion into the oil supply or oil systems. Typical situations include the following:

1. The quench system was idle for a long period of time.
2. The quench oil was transferred in temporary storage containers.
3. A nearby sprinkler system was activated.
4. The roof leaked.
5. The water-oil heat exchanger leaked.

Bulk oil storage systems should be checked for water periodically. Quench oil that operates below 212°F (100°C) should be checked for water content periodically.

### A.13.5.13.7.5(A) Hot Plate Laboratory Method

The hot plate laboratory method test consists of dropping a few drops of quench oil sample on a hot, flat, metal plate with a temperature of 225°F to 275°F (107°C to 135°C). If the fluid snaps and spatters when it contacts the hot plate, water is present. If the oil becomes thin and smokes, no water is present. This method does not determine the percentage of water, only the presence of water. If a quantitative analysis is performed, the water content in the quench oil should not exceed 0.5 percent by volume.

### A.13.5.13.7.5(B) Sampling Procedure

The sampling procedure should consider the most likely location where water occurs. Water does not mix easily with quench oil, and water is heavier than oil. In some quench systems, the quench oil should be agitated, all pumps should be operated for a period of time, and the oil then should be left still for a time before the sample is removed from the lowest floor of the quench tank. In other quench systems, the quench oil should be well agitated and the sample removed from a turbulent region.

### A.13.5.13.7.5(C) Contamination Possibilities

The following are examples of when contamination is a possibility:

1. After a shutdown
2. After a heat exchanger leak

### Oil Quenching Hazards

#### A.13.5.14 Fire Hazards in Oil Quenching

Fire is the principal hazard in oil quenching. When hot metal is quenched in oil, an envelope of vapors forms around the piece. Large vapor bubbles, which can have temperatures above auto-ignition temperature, rise to the surface and sometimes flash into flame momentarily. Additional localized surface flashing also occurs around the work as the metal enters the oil but is extinguished readily by normal agitation of the oil.

There are three general types of quench oil fires that can reach serious proportions in the absence of sprinkler protection:

1. **First Type of Fire**: This most common type occurs when the oil is at its normal temperature below the flash point. The red-hot work hangs up, partially submerged at the surface, heating the oil locally above its flash point. The fire develops slowly, and if the work is promptly submerged or removed from the tank, it can be extinguished with portable extinguishing equipment or by agitating the oil.

2. **Second Type of Fire**: This occurs when the main body of oil is heated above the flash point due to failure or inadequacy of the tank's cooling system or introduction of an excessive workload. This type of fire reaches full intensity in only a few seconds and is very difficult to extinguish with portable equipment. Above 212°F (100°C), the heated oil turns water to steam. When water is discharged on the fire, the tank can experience frothover. Fire spreads suddenly over the adjacent floor area, and firefighters are forced back by intense heat and smoke. (Water spray discharged from sprinklers penetrates the oil surface less readily than the solid hose stream and, consequently, causes less violent frothover.)

3. **Third Type of Fire**: This is caused by oil contacting the hot furnace as a result of:
   - Overfilling the tank
   - Splashing caused by the discharge from recirculation nozzles under conditions of low oil level
   - Steam formation if water gets into the tank because of leakage from cooling coils and the temperature reaches 212°F (100°C), or if the hot work penetrates the water layer

In open tanks, formation of steam below the surface causes foaming and frothover. In enclosed tanks, pressure builds up and oil or flammable furnace atmosphere shoots out of openings. Intense burning can occur over a wide area.

Figure A.13.5.14 shows an example of an oil quench tank arrangement. Protection requirements for open quench tanks are included in Chapter 13.

#### A.13.5.14.3.2(E) Temperature Limit Switch

A dual-set point excess temperature limit switch arranged to actuate the alarm prior to the other operations can be used.

#### A.13.5.15 Hazards in Molten Salt Bath Furnaces

The potential hazards in the operation of molten salt bath furnaces can result in explosions, fires, or both, either inside the salt bath furnace or outside the furnace. Basic causes can be chemical or physical reactions or a combination. Because molten salts have high heating potential, low viscosities, and relatively little surface tension, even minor physical disturbances to the molten salt bath can result in spattering or ejection of the molten salt out of the furnace container. This ejection can become violent when liquids (e.g., water, oil) or reactive materials are allowed to penetrate the surface of the salt bath.

Nitrate salts can produce violent explosions because of chemical chain reactions when the nitrate salt is overheated.

Overheating can result from a malfunction of the heating system controls, a floating or "hung-up" workload, or an operator processing error.

While NFPA 86 deals primarily with the protection and conservation of property, salt bath explosions (chemical or physical) could involve injury to personnel. As a result, it is recommended that all aspects of personnel safety be investigated thoroughly.

### A.13.5.15.2.2(A) 
Most salts are hygroscopic.

### A.13.5.15.4.1 
Fume hoods are necessary to remove and appropriately control the emission of heat and toxic (or otherwise deleterious) fumes.

### A.13.5.15.6.1 
See Figure A.13.5.15.6.1.

### A.13.5.15.6.2(A) 
Free carbon or soot in contact with nitrate salt is hazardous.

### A.13.5.15.6.2(D) 
1. See Figure A.13.5.15.6.1.
2. See Figure A.13.5.15.6.1.

### A.13.5.15.6.3(A) 
Free carbon or soot in contact with nitrate salt is hazardous.

### A.13.5.15.8 
Because of the potential for the spattering of the molten salts, it is recommended that consideration be given to the provision of heat-resistant clothing, safety glasses or goggles, full faceshields, heat-resistant gloves, safety shoes, and all other personnel protection recommended by the equipment manufacturer, user standards, industrial safety standards, and local, state, or federal requirements.

### A.13.5.15.9.2 
In deep, pot-type, molten salt equipment, provisions should be made for keeping the upper burners fired until the salt is melted before firing the bottom burner. In shallow, pot-type, molten salt equipment, a solid rod or open cylinder tube should be placed in the pot when the pot is not being used in order to conduct heat from the bottom of the pot. This provision makes an opening in the crust and avoids eruptions.

### A.14.2.2.1 
Vacuum gauges might contain controlling devices to operate equipment sequentially.

### A.14.2.4.2 
The furnace cooling system can include a vessel cooling system and one or more methods for cooling material in process. The systems might include gas quenching, oil quenching, or water quenching. Internal or external heat exchangers are permitted to be used and generally require supplementary cooling. Special atmospheres might be used for cooling.

### A.14.2.4.4 
Consideration should be given to the provision of flow indicators or temperature gauges on exit cooling lines.

# Document Standardization and Formatting

## A.14.2.5 Gas Quenching Process

After the thermal cycle has been completed, the workload is either transferred to a gas quenching vestibule or gas-quenched in the heating zone. Gas quenching is performed by introducing a cooling gas (usually nitrogen, hydrogen, argon, or helium) until the pressure reaches a predetermined level [usually from a gauge pressure of 2 psi (13.8 kPa) to a gauge pressure of 12 psi above atmospheric]. The cooling gas is recirculated through a heat exchanger and over the work by means of a fan or blower. The heat exchanger and fans or blower can be either internal (within the furnace vacuum chamber) or external (outside the furnace vacuum chamber).

## A.14.2.6 Vacuum Pump Information

See Annex I for general pump information.

### A.14.2.6.1 Types of Vacuum Pumps

Vacuum pumps can be of the ejector, liquid ring, mechanical, cryopump, or diffusion type.

### A.14.2.6.3 Diffusion Pump Recommendations

It is recommended that diffusion pumps be charged with a vacuum grade of silicon-based fluid to reduce the risk of explosion upon inadvertent exposure to air when heated. Diffusion pump fluids with equivalent or superior fire resistance should be considered.

## A.14.2.9 Suitable Materials

### A.14.2.9.1 General Material Suitability

Suitable materials generally include graphite, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, and others.

### A.14.2.9.4 Reaction of Dissimilar Metals

Where dissimilar metals are heated in contact with each other, particularly when they are oxide-free and used within a vacuum furnace, they can react and form alloys or a eutectic. The result is an alloy that melts at a considerably lower temperature than the melting point of either base metal. Critical melting temperatures of some eutectic-forming materials are listed in Table A.14.2.9.4. Operating temperatures near or above these points should be considered carefully.

#### Table A.14.2.9.4 Eutectic Melting Temperatures

| Material             | Melting Temperature (°F) | Melting Temperature (°C) |
| :------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------- |
| Molybdenum-nickel    | 2310                     | 1266                     |
| Molybdenum-titanium  | 2210                     | 1210                     |
| Molybdenum-carbon    | 2700                     | 1482                     |
| Nickel-carbon        | 2310                     | 1266                     |
| Nickel-tantalum      | 2450                     | 1343                     |
| Nickel-titanium      | 1730                     | 943                      |

## A.14.2.10 Heat Transfer and Insulation

The heat energy produced by the heating elements transfers into the work principally by means of radiation and through the insulation or heat shields into the cooled walls of the vacuum vessel. The cooling medium is continually circulated through the walls of the vessel, maintaining a cold wall. Generally, water is used as the cooling medium.

### A.14.2.10.1 Insulation Examples

Examples of proper insulation include graphite wool, alumina-silica fibers, and other materials.

### A.14.2.10.3 Acceptable Metals for Heat Shields

Molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, palladium, and 304/316 stainless steel are examples of acceptable metals to be used for heat shields.

### A.14.2.10.4 Airborne Material Concerns

Airborne material can block heat exchangers and cause vacuum valve seals to leak on furnaces that use forced gas quenching.

## A.14.5.1.2 Pressure Monitoring

Monitoring pressure in the roughing line has no impact on furnace or personnel safety. However, monitoring pressure in the diffusion pump foreline is important to both equipment and personnel safety. The calibration of all vacuum gauges should follow the standards specified by the American Vacuum Society.

### Mechanical Gauges

The bellows and diaphragm mechanical gauges operate on a differential between atmospheric and process pressure. They are compensated for atmospheric pressure changes and calibrated for absolute pressure units. They are not suited for high vacuum work, being limited to approximately 1 mm Hg (133 Pa) absolute. Readout is approximately linear except when calibrated in altitude units. Electrical output is available.

# Vacuum Gauges

## McLeod Gauge

For high vacuum work, the McLeod gauge is often used as a primary standard for the calibration of other, more easily used instruments. The gauge is limited to intermittent sampling rather than continuous use. It operates on the principle of compressing a large known volume (V₁) of gas at unknown system pressure (P₁) into a much smaller volume (V₂) at a known higher pressure (P₂), as derived from Boyle's law, at constant temperature. The gauge then is calibrated to read P₁.

## Thermal Gauges

The operation of a thermal gauge is based on the theory that energy dissipated from a hot surface is proportional to the pressure of the surrounding gas. Some manufacturers produce thermal gauges that are subject to contamination by vaporized materials, and this issue should be discussed with the gauge manufacturer. The following are types of thermal gauges:

1. **Thermocouple Gauge**: The thermocouple gauge contains a V-shaped filament with a small thermocouple attached to the point. At low absolute pressures, the cooling effect on the heated filament is proportional to the pressure of the surrounding gas. Therefore, the thermocouple electromagnetic field (emf) can be used to indicate pressure. To compensate for ambient temperature, an identical second unit is sealed in an evacuated tube. The differential output of the two thermocouples is proportional to the pressure.

2. **Pirani Gauge**: The Pirani gauge employs a Wheatstone bridge circuit. This circuit balances the resistance of a tungsten filament sealed off in high vacuum against that of a tungsten filament that can lose heat to the gas being measured by means of conduction. In the Pirani gauge, the resistance of the filament, rather than its temperature, is used as an indication of pressure.

3. **Bimetal Gauge**: A bimetallic spiral is heated by a stabilized power source. Any change of pressure causes a change of temperature and, therefore, a deflection of the spiral, which is linked to a pointer on a scale that indicates pressure.

## Ionization Gauges

The two types of ionization gauges are the hot filament (hot cathode) gauge and the cold cathode (Phillips or discharge) gauge. Their principle of operation is based on the fact that collisions between molecules and electrons result in the formation of ions. The rate of ion formation varies directly with pressure. Measurement of the ion current can be translated into units of gas pressure. The two types of ionization gauges are as follows:

1. **Hot Filament (Hot Cathode) Gauge**: This gauge is constructed like an electron tube. It has a tungsten filament surrounded by a coil grid, which in turn is surrounded by a collector plate. Electrons emitted from the heated filament are accelerated toward the positively charged coil grid. The accelerated electrons pass through the coil grid into the space between the grid and the negatively charged collector plate. Some electrons collide with gas molecules from the vacuum system to produce positive ions. The positive current is a function of the number of ions formed and therefore a measure of the pressure of the system. Ionization gauge-sensing elements are extremely delicate and should be handled carefully. Their filaments can burn out if accidentally exposed to pressures above 1 × 10⁻³ mm Hg (1.3 × 10⁻¹ Pa) absolute. The advantages of this type of gauge are high sensitivity and the ability to measure extremely high vacuums.

## Cold Cathode (Phillips or Discharge) Gauge

A cold cathode gauge employs the principle of measuring an ion current produced by a discharge of high voltage. Electrons from the cathode of the sensing element spiral as they move across a magnetic field to the anode. With this spiraling, the electron mean-free path greatly exceeds the distance between electrodes. Therefore, the possibility of a collision with the gas molecules present is increased, producing greater sensitivity (due to greater ion current) and thus sustaining the cathode discharge at lower pressure (i.e., high vacuum).

The sensing elements are rugged and well-suited to production applications where unskilled help might make filament burnout a problem.

### A.14.5.1.4

Providing automatic valves would help prevent pump oil or air from passing through the system or causing damage to the furnace or load.

### A.14.5.1.6

An example warning label reads as follows:

**WARNING:** Do not open oil drain or fill plugs for service until the pump heater is at room temperature. Otherwise, ignition of pump oil can occur with rapid expansion of gas, causing damage to the pump and furnace hot zone.

### A.14.5.1.7.1

The formation of steam pockets can cause an explosion.

### A.14.5.1.7.2

If the electron beam becomes fixed on one spot, burn-through of a water circuit could occur.

### A.14.5.1.7.5

Accelerating voltages run as high as 100 kV and present a shock or X-ray hazard.

### A.14.5.2.1

Integral liquid quench systems might be constructed within the furnace vacuum chamber or might be in quench vestibules separated from the heating portion of the chamber with a door or vacuum-tight valve. Semicontinuous furnaces employ valves on each end of the hot vacuum zone.

These furnaces might be divided into three separate chambers: a loading vestibule, a hot vacuum chamber, and a cooling vestibule. With this arrangement, cooling or pressurizing the hot vacuum chamber is not required for loading and unloading. Cooling vestibules are often equipped with elevators so that loads can be quenched by vacuum, gas, or oil.

### A.14.5.2.2.2

Although carbon steel plate was used for many years with water cooling, its use is no longer permitted because corrosion is continuous and the extent of it is difficult to determine. In existing installations where carbon steel has been used with water-based coolants, the wall thickness should be tested periodically to determine the corrosion rate and predict the remaining life.

### A.14.5.2.4.1

Quench medium tanks generally utilize a cooling system to maintain the quench medium at an operating temperature to reduce the quantity of quench media required. The three basic cooling systems in general use consist of the following:

1. Internal cooler, where a heat transfer medium is circulated through a heat exchanger within the quench tank.
2. External cooler in which a quench medium is withdrawn from a quench tank, circulated through a water-cooled heat exchanger, and returned.
3. External cooler in which a quench medium is withdrawn from a quench tank, circulated through an air-cooled heat exchanger, and returned.

### A.14.5.2.4.2(B)

Maximum working pressure should include allowance for vacuum conditions.

### A.14.5.2.4.3(B)

Maximum working pressure should include allowance for vacuum conditions.

# A.14.5.2.6.11 Quench Oil Testing

## A.14.5.2.6.11(A) Hot Plate Laboratory Method

The hot plate laboratory method test consists of dropping a few drops of quench oil sample on a hot, flat metal plate with a temperature of 225°F to 275°F (107°C to 135°C). If the fluid snaps and spatters when it contacts the hot plate, water is present. If the oil becomes thin and smokes, no water is present. This method does not determine the percentage of water, only the presence of water. If a quantitative analysis of the water is performed, the water content of the oil should not exceed 0.5 percent by volume.

## A.14.5.2.6.11(B) Sampling Procedure

The sampling procedure should consider the location where water is most likely to occur. Water does not mix easily with quench oil, and water is heavier than oil. In some quench systems, the quench oil should be agitated, all pumps should be operated for a period of time, and the oil then should be left still for a time before the sample is removed from the lowest floor of the quench tank. In other quench systems, the quench oil should be well agitated and the sample removed from a turbulent region.

## A.14.5.2.6.11(C) Contamination Possibilities

The following are examples of when contamination is a possibility:

1. After a shutdown
2. After a heat exchanger leak
3. After any components in the oil-cooling, agitation, or recirculation system are replaced
4. After a water-extinguished fire in the area
5. After a significant addition of new or used oil

# A.14.5.3 Safety Considerations

## A.14.5.3.1.6 Air Retention

If a residual amount of air is retained in an external chamber, the inadvertent opening of a valve to an external system in the presence of a flammable atmosphere could create an explosive mixture.

## A.14.5.3.1.12 Sight Glass Cracking

Cracking of a sight glass, which is not unusual, can admit air into the chamber or allow flammable gas to escape.

## A.14.5.3.4 Power Failure

In case of electric power failure, all of the following systems could stop functioning:

1. Heating system
2. Flammable atmosphere gas system
3. Vacuum pumping system

# A.14.5.4 Storage Systems Compliance

Storage systems should comply with the following NFPA standards:

1. Liquefied petroleum gas systems should be in accordance with NFPA 58, *Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code*.
2. Gas piping should be in accordance with NFPA 54, *National Fuel Gas Code*.
3. Hydrogen storage systems should be in accordance with NFPA 55, *Compressed Gases and Cryogenic Fluids Code*.
4. Oxygen storage systems shall be in accordance with NFPA 55.

Processing atmosphere gas storage systems not covered by an NFPA standard or code (e.g., anhydrous ammonia) should be installed in accordance with supplier requirements and all applicable local, state, and federal codes.

# A.14.5.5 Furnace Design Considerations

## A.14.5.5.1.2 Water-Cooled Vessel Design

The bottom third of a water-cooled vessel of a vacuum induction melting furnace should be trace-cooled instead of jacketed in order to provide minimum water storage in the event of a melting crucible breakthrough. The bottom of the furnace chamber should be equipped with a separate cooling circuit that can be valved off in the event of a molten metal burn-through of the chamber. The quality of the cooling water should be considered to minimize plugging of the induction coil or coils and to minimize corrosion of or attack on all water-cooled components.

## A.14.5.5.2 Power Supply

The purpose of the power supply is to transform the power line to a suitable voltage and current (and, where necessary, to convert from 60 Hz to another frequency) to energize the induction coil. Consideration should be given to furnishing the power supply with a means of proportioning control.

Generally, this is accomplished with a motor generator, an electronic oscillator, or silicon-controlled, solid-state converter units. In most cases, a DC control signal is provided for proportioning control. The design of the power supply is specific to the individual furnace and size.

The power supply can include a transformer (or a motor generator), capacitors with control switches as necessary, a control device such as a saturable core reactor, primary fuses or circuit breakers for electrical protection, and an electrical disconnect switch for service. A power controller is permitted to be used where necessary to accept a signal from the furnace temperature controller.

The power supply output voltage should be limited to a maximum of 80 volts for noninsulated induction coils in order to prevent electrical breakdown or internal furnace arcing. As the atmospheric pressure is reduced in the vacuum chamber, arcing voltage changes. This voltage change is a function of electrical spacing and pressure. This function is not linear but has a minimum value for most gases used as cooling or partial pressure media in vacuum furnaces. If the voltage stress and mean-free path relationship reaches a critical value, corona discharge and arcing commence as a result of the field emission of electrons. For insulated induction coils, the operating voltage can be adjusted accordingly to ensure safe operation.

# UL Bulletin of Research No. 43

This UL Bulletin of Research No. 43 reports an investigation conducted by Underwriters Laboratories Inc. to determine the lower limit of flammability (upward propagation) and the autogenous ignition temperature of certain common solvent vapors encountered in industrial ovens. The solvents included:

- Acetone
- Iso-amyl acetate
- Benzene
- Normal butyl alcohol
- Cyclohexane
- Cyclohexanone
- Meta or para cresol
- Ethyl alcohol
- Ethyl lactate
- Gasoline
- Normal hexane
- High solvency petroleum naphtha
- Methyl alcohol
- Methyl ethyl ketone
- Methyl lactate
- No. 10 Mineral Spirits
- Toluene
- Turpentine
- VM and P naphtha

## Lower Limits of Flammability

The lower limits of flammability of the solvent vapors in air at initial temperatures encountered in the operation of ovens were determined in a specially designed, electrically heated, closed explosion vessel of steel having a capacity of 1 ft³ (0.028 m³) [15¼ in. (387 mm) high, 12 in. (305 mm) internal diameter]. It was equipped with an observation window, an externally driven mixing fan, and inlet and outlet valves. A transformer rated 15,000 V, 60 mA, 60 cycles for the secondary and having a 0.009 mfd condenser connected across the secondary was used to produce an electric discharge for ignition.

The lower limits of flammability of all solvents included in this investigation were found to be lowered on increasing the initial ambient temperature. These changes in the lower limits are of such magnitude that they cannot be safely neglected in practical calculations of the amount of ventilation required to prevent the formation of hazardous concentrations of the vapors of the solvents in industrial ovens. The magnitude of the change in the lower limit with a given increase in initial temperature varied with the different solvents.

## Autogenous Ignition Temperature

The autogenous ignition temperature (in air) of the solvent vapors was determined in combustion chambers of iron, stainless steel (AISI Type No. 302), copper, zinc, and yellow brass, representing metals commonly used in oven construction. Determinations in glass and quartz chambers were included for comparison. The autogenous ignition temperature of the solvents is influenced to some extent by catalytic or other reactions of the solvent vapor-air mixtures with the heated metals or their oxides. Whether the ignition temperature of the solvent is increased or decreased (as compared with values obtained with glass or quartz combustion chambers) depends on the particular combinations of solvent vapor and metals.

The ignition temperatures of solvents in metal chambers were higher, for the most part, than the ignition temperatures of the same solvents in glass or quartz chambers. However, exceptions were found where the values obtained in the metal chambers were lower (e.g., butyl alcohol in copper and brass chambers). The autogenous ignition temperature of many solvents included in the investigation is within the range of temperatures encountered in industrial ovens and, if conditions allow the formation of flammable vapor-air mixtures in the oven, autogenous ignition can occur.

**Note:** In calculating ventilation requirements for batch ovens operating from 250°F to 500°F (121°C to 260°C), values for the lower flammable limit of the solvent determined at the operating temperature of the oven should be used where such data are available. However, where the data are obtainable only for room temperature, a correction factor is required. An averaged factor of 1.4 has been obtained from a graph of the experimental data plotted for a number of selected solvents over temperature ranges of 70°F to 250°F (21°C to 121°C) (1.25) and 250°F to 500°F (121°C to 260°C) (1.56).

## Annex E: Continuous Solvent Vapor Concentration Indicator and Controller

This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document but is included for informational purposes only.

# Solvent Vapor Analyzer Systems

A solvent vapor concentration indicator is a measurement system that determines the solvent vapor concentration in a Class A oven, expressed as a percentage of the lower flammable limit (LFL), also called the lower explosive limit (LEL). It is required for the safe operation of ovens at solvent concentrations above 25 percent LFL. The measurement system consists of three integral parts, as follows:

1. **The gas sample system** that delivers the oven atmosphere sample to the analyzer.
2. **The solvent vapor concentration analyzer.**
3. **The safety logic system** that is activated by the analyzer.

The oven atmosphere should be sampled at a point that best represents the average concentration of solvent vapor in the oven or oven zone. This usually is at the oven exhaust point. Care should be taken to provide sufficient turbulence within the oven to avoid significant pockets of high solvent concentration. The sample system consists of a sample pickup tube, sample line, sample pump, and filter or other sample conditioning devices. The volume of the sample system should be as small as possible, and the sample flow rate should be maximized for fast response of the system. Special precautions, such as heating the sample lines and analyzer to prevent condensation of volatiles in the sample system, might be required. The length of the sample line should be minimized by locating the analyzer close to the sample point.

The solvent vapor concentration analyzer can be one of several types. The choice of the appropriate type depends on factors such as the solvent composition, the need for calibration of more than one solvent, the necessary response time of the measurement system, and the ability to handle factors such as contaminants and oxygen content. The types of analyzers used are described as follows:

1. **Catalytic Combustion:** Combustion of solvent vapor occurs on a heated catalyst surface, such as a platinum wire. The heat of combustion causes a change in electrical resistance, which is calibrated in terms of percent LFL. Because the measurement is based on combustion, the calibration does vary significantly for different solvents. However, contamination of the catalyst with silicones can cause a calibration shift.

2. **Infrared:** The sample is passed through a measurement cell where infrared energy is absorbed by the solvent vapor and compared with the energy absorbed in a reference cell containing background gas. Contamination by silicone is not a problem with this type of analyzer, but the calibration is specific to certain classes of solvents and varies considerably for various solvent types. Its area of application is for single solvent systems where silicone poisoning might be a problem.

3. **Flame Temperature:** This is a combustion-type analyzer in which solvent vapor in the sample is burned as it passes through a chamber containing a small, constantly burning flame. A temperature sensor is located immediately above the flame. The temperature varies with the amount of solvent burned in the flame and is calibrated in percent LFL. Contamination by silicones is not a problem, and calibration is relatively constant for various solvents.

4. **Flame Ionization:** Ionization of solvent vapor in contact with a hydrogen flame causes a change in electrical properties that is measured and calibrated in percent LFL. This method also is used to measure very low concentrations of solvent vapor. Very rapid response could be obtained, but the calibration varies for some types of solvents.

All of the various types of analyzers are to be routinely calibrated using zero and span gas. Standards require initial calibration for the specific solvents being measured.

The safety logic system involves high limit contacts in the analyzer or recorder, or both, that stop the conveyor or other means of solvent introduction and actuate dampers or fan motor drives to provide maximum makeup air and exhaust. Other parts of the analyzer logic system include flowmeters and pressure switches to verify the proper operation of the sample system. The solvent vapor concentration analyzer also can be utilized to control the percent LFL in the oven by modulation of the makeup air or exhaust.

It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the solvent vapor concentration measurement system is to have a very fast response time so that corrective action will be taken in response to upsets such as excessive introduction of solvent into the oven. A response time of as little as 5 seconds might be required in some cases.

## E.2 LFL Values and Calibration Concerns

Proper operation of a continuous solvent vapor concentration analyzer requires careful calibration for the correct LFL values of the particular solvent or solvent mixtures and for response of the analyzer to the particular solvents.

### E.2.1 LFL Values and Temperature Corrections

LFL values for many commonly used solvents are given in Table A.11.6.8.4(a) and Table A.11.6.8.4(b). Additional data can be found in NFPA 325, Fire-Hazard Properties of Flammable Liquids, Gases and Volatile Solids. (Note: Although NFPA 325 has been officially withdrawn from the National Fire Codes, the information is still available in NFPA's Fire Protection Guide to Hazardous Materials.)

For mixtures of solvents, the LFL of the mixture is calculated by the following formula:

\[ LFL \text{ mixture } = \frac{100}{(P_1/L_1)+(P_2/L_2)+···(P_n/L_n)} \]  

where:  
- \( P_{1, 2, ..., n} \) = % by volume of component 1, 2, ..., n  
- \( L_{1, 2, ..., n} \) = LFL value of each solvent  

### E.2.2 Instrument Calibration Factors

The solvent vapor analyzer systems described in Section E.1 respond differently to various solvent vapors. Instrument calibration to the specific solvent vapor or solvent mixture vapor is required both before initial operation of the instrument and on some routine schedule after initial operation.

#### E.2.2.1 Initial Calibration

The instrument should be calibrated initially with the solvent vapor or solvent mixture vapor used in the oven application. A label describing this calibration should be affixed to the instrument. A permanent record of this calibration should be included with records for the instrument.

The user should understand how the instrument responds to vapors for which the instrument is not calibrated, including other solvent vapors or mixtures of solvent vapors present in the sample and vapors whose relative response data are not known. The instrument manufacturer should be consulted for guidance in such cases.

The initial calibration should be based on worst-case considerations, including the following:

1. If a variety or mixture of solvent vapors is to be present, the instrument should be calibrated for the solvent vapor that produces the lowest instrument signal. All other solvent vapors should indicate a meter value greater than the actual concentration, so that any error in reading is always in a safe or early warning direction.

2. Solvent mixtures containing minor components can be calibrated without the minor components where the estimated error produced is less than 3 percent of the meter reading.

3. When calculating the LFL value and oven temperature correction as provided in Table 11.6.8.3(A), the maximum oven temperature should be used.

#### E.2.2.2 Field Calibration

Solvent vapor analyzer systems require field calibration checks during normal operation to verify the accuracy of the system. The manufacturer should supply the user with a recommended schedule for calibration checks. This schedule should be contained in the operating instructions for the specific instrument used.

It is recommended that field calibrations be made using a known concentration of the actual solvent vapor present in the process.

Field calibration also can be performed using a known concentration of reference test gas in situations where use of the actual solvent vapor present is not possible. This reference test gas could be used as a substitute for the actual solvent vapor, and meter reading adjustments can be made based on test gas response data supplied by the instrument manufacturer.

The use of relative response data in making field calibration checks is not recommended.

Certain materials, including but not limited to silicones, sulfur compounds, phosphorus compounds, chlorinated compounds, and halogenated hydrocarbons, have a poisoning or inhibiting effect on some solvent vapor analyzers. These materials produce a loss in sensitivity in certain instruments. If the presence of desensitizing materials in the sample is known or suspected, instrument field calibration checks should be performed on a more frequent basis. The instrument manufacturer should be consulted for guidance on calibration frequency in these situations.

## Annex F: Steam Extinguishing Systems

*This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document but is included for informational purposes only.*

### F.1 General

Steam extinguishes fire by the exclusion of air or the reduction of the oxygen content of the atmosphere in a manner similar to that of carbon dioxide or other inert gases. The use of steam precedes other modern smothering systems. Steam is not a practical extinguishing agent except where a large steam supply is continuously available. The possible burn hazard should be considered in any steam extinguishing installation. A visible cloud of condensed vapor, popularly described as steam, is incapable of extinguishment.

Although many fires have been extinguished by steam, its use often has been unsuccessful due to lack of understanding of its limitations. Except for specialized applications, other types of smothering systems are preferred in modern practice. No complete standard covering steam smothering systems has yet been developed.

One pound of saturated steam at 212°F (100°C) and normal atmospheric pressure has a volume of 26.75 ft³ (0.76 m³). A larger percentage of steam is required to prevent combustion than in the case of other inert gases used for fire extinguishment. Fires in substances that form glowing coals are difficult to extinguish with steam, owing to the lack of cooling effect. For some types of fire, such as fires involving ammonium nitrate and similar oxidizing materials, steam is completely ineffective.

Steam smothering systems should be permitted only where oven temperatures exceed 225°F (107°C) and where large supplies of steam are available at all times while the oven is in operation. Complete standards paralleling those for other extinguishing agents have not been developed for the use of steam as an extinguishing agent, and, until this is done, the use of this form of protection is not as dependable, nor are the results as certain, as those provided by water, carbon dioxide, dry chemical, or foam.

Release devices for steam smothering systems should be manual, and controls should be arranged to close down oven outlets to the extent practicable.

### F.2 Life Hazard

- **F.2.1** Equipment should be arranged to prevent operating of steam valves when doors of box-type ovens or access doors or panels of conveyor ovens are open.

- **F.2.2** A separate outside steam manual shutoff valve should be provided for closing off the steam supply during oven cleaning. The valve should be locked closed whenever employees are in the oven.

## F.2.3 Main Valve Design

The main valve should be designed to open slowly because the release should first open a small bypass. This allows time for employees in the vicinity to escape and also protects the piping from severe water hammer. A steam trap should be connected to the steam supply near the main valve to keep this line free of condensate.

## F.3 Steam Outlets

If steam is used, steam outlets should be sufficiently large to supply 8 lb/min (3.6 kg/min) of steam for each 100 ft³ (2.8 m³) of oven volume. The outlets preferably should be located near the bottom of the oven, but if the oven is not over 20 ft (6.1 m) high, they might be located near the top, pointing downward. Steam jets should be directed at dip tanks in a manner to avoid disturbing the liquid surface or other areas of special hazard.

3. **Pressure-Relief Valves**: Test pressure-relief valves; if necessary, clean or replace them.
4. **Piping Inspection**: Inspect air, water, fuel, and impulse piping for leaks.
5. **Radiant and Heat Exchanger Tubes**: Inspect radiant tubes and heat exchanger tubes for leakage; if necessary, repair them.
6. **Lubrication**: Lubricate the instrumentation, valve motors, valves, blowers, compressors, pumps, and other components.
7. **Instrumentation Testing**: Test instrumentation in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations.
8. **Flame Safeguard Units**: Test flame safeguard units.

### G.5 Maintenance of Gas Equipment

#### G.5.1 General

These recommendations are prepared for the maintenance of gas equipment. Special types of equipment need special attention. A preventive maintenance program that includes adherence to the manufacturers' recommendations should be established and followed. This program should establish a minimum maintenance schedule that includes inspection and action on the recommendations provided in G.5.2 through G.5.5. An adequate supply of spare parts should be maintained.

#### G.5.2 Burners and Pilots

Burners and pilots should be kept clean and in proper operating condition. Burner refractory parts should be examined at frequent, regular intervals to ensure good condition.

#### G.5.3 Flame Safeguard Equipment

Where automatic flame safeguards are used, a complete shutdown and restart should be made at frequent intervals to check the components for proper operation.

#### G.5.4 Other Safeguard Equipment

Accessory safeguard equipment — such as manual reset valves, automatic safety shutoff valves, pressure or vacuum switches, high temperature limit switches, draft control, manual shutoff valves, airflow switches, door switches, and gas valves — should be operated at frequent, regular intervals to ensure proper functioning. If inoperative, they should be repaired or replaced promptly.

Where fire checks are installed in air-gas mixture piping, the pressure loss across the fire checks should be measured at regular intervals. Where excessive pressure loss is found, screens should be removed and cleaned. Water-type backfire checks should be inspected at frequent intervals, and the liquid level should be maintained.

#### G.5.5 Safety Shutoff Valves

All safety shutoff valves should be checked for leakage and proper operation at frequent, regular intervals. An example procedure for testing gas safety shutoff valves is outlined in A.7.4.9.

### G.6 Maintenance of Electric Furnaces and Equipment

#### G.6.1 General

A program of regular inspection and maintenance of electric furnaces is essential to the safe operation of that equipment. Manufacturer's recommendations should be followed rigorously, resulting in a long, trouble-free furnace life. Suitable spare parts should be stocked to ensure quick replacement as needed.

#### G.6.2 Heating Elements

The heating elements should be inspected at regular intervals and any foreign contamination removed. Repair is essential if elements are dislodged or distorted, causing them to touch alloy hearths or furnace components so that grounding or shorting can occur. Element terminals should be checked periodically and tightened because loose connections cause arcing and oxidation that can result in burn-out of the terminal.

#### G.6.3 Insulation and Refractory Materials

Furnace linings need attention where protective atmospheres are used, to make certain that excessive carbon has not been deposited. Grounding or shorting of the elements can occur unless recommended burn-out procedures are followed. Cracked or broken refractory element supports should be replaced as necessary.

# G.6 Maintenance Guidelines

## G.6.4 Thermocouples

A regular replacement program should be established for all control and safety thermocouples. The effective life of thermocouples varies, depending on the environment and the temperature, and these factors should be considered in setting up a replacement schedule.

## G.6.5 Auxiliary and Control Devices

Contactors should be checked and replaced periodically where pitting due to arcing could result in welding of the contacts and uncontrolled application of power to the furnace. All control components, including pyrometers and relays, should be checked periodically to ensure proper operation or control accuracy. Instructions provided by the manufacturer of each control component should be followed with care.

## G.6.6 Voltage

The voltage supplied to electric furnaces should be maintained within reasonable limits to ensure against overloading of control devices and transformers. Undervoltage can result in operational failure of relays and solenoid valves.

## G.6.7 Water Cooling

If components are water-cooled, it is important to check the flow and the temperature of the cooling water frequently.

## G.6.8 Interlocks

Periodic checks of all safety interlocks are essential. High-frequency generators should have functioning door interlocks to prevent operators from entering the enclosure while any power is on. These safety devices should be checked frequently.

# Annex H Vacuum Furnace Maintenance Checklist

# Annex K: Vacuum Symbols

*This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document but is included for informational purposes only.*

## K.1 General

This annex is reprinted from the AVS *Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology*, “Graphic Symbols in Vacuum Technology.”

### Introduction

**Purpose:** The purpose of this standard is to establish a uniform system of graphic symbols in vacuum technology.

**Definition and Application:** The graphic symbols are a shorthand used to show graphically the functioning and interconnections of vacuum components in a single-line schematic or flow diagram. A single-line diagram is one in which the graphic symbols are shown without regard to the actual physical location, size, or shape of the components. A symbol shall be considered as the aggregate of all its parts. The orientation of a symbol on a drawing, including a mirror image presentation, does not alter the meaning of the symbol. A symbol might be drawn to any scale that suits a particular drawing. Arrows should be omitted unless necessary for clarification.

**Explanation:** The graphic symbols are divided into two separate sections, general and specific symbols. Wherever possible, the general symbol illustrates the function or appearance of a component without regard to special features. The special symbols elaborate upon the general component categories with individual symbols that illustrate in detail the special features of the component. Wherever possible, the special symbol utilizes the general symbol outline. (See Figure K.1.)

For definitions of the terms used in the description column, see *American Vacuum Society, Glossary of Terms Used in Vacuum Technology*.

# NFPA 86

## Standard for Ovens and Furnaces

2015 Edition

**Reference:** 3.3.69.7  
**F.I. No.:** 86-07-1

### Formal Interpretation

**Question 1:** Is a listed safety shutoff valve with proof-of-closure switch compliant with NFPA 86 when the proof-of-closure switch is enclosed under a cover plate affixed with standard head screws?

**Answer:** Yes.

**Question 2:** Is a listed safety shutoff valve with proof-of-closure switch compliant with NFPA 86 when its proof-of-closure switch is capable of being replaced in the field?

**Answer:** Yes.

**Committee Statement:** Some safety shutoff valves required by NFPA 86 are to include proof-of-closure switches. The definition of “Proof-of-Closure Switch" includes “non-field adjustable" as one characteristic of the switch. Some listed safety shutoff valves have proof-of-closure switches that can be accessed by removing a cover plate affixed with standard head screws. Some "listed" safety shutoff valves have proof-of-closure switches that can be replaced and adjusted as part of field servicing activities. In each case, the proof-of-closure switch is not accessible to an operator for field adjustment, but the proof-of-closure switch can be accessed by deliberate disassembly of the valve for service activity. In accordance with the standard, all safety devices require periodic testing and maintenance in accordance with published manufacturer's instructions.

## Sequence of Events for the Standards Development Process

As soon as the current edition is published, a Standard is open for Public Input.

### Step 1: Input Stage

- Input accepted from the public or other committees for consideration to develop the First Draft
- Committee holds First Draft Meeting to revise Standard (23 weeks)
- Committee(s) with Correlating Committee (10 weeks)
- Committee ballots on First Draft (12 weeks)
- Committee(s) with Correlating Committee (11 weeks)
- Correlating Committee First Draft Meeting (9 weeks)
- Correlating Committee ballots on First Draft (5 weeks)
- First Draft Report posted

### Step 2: Comment Stage

- Public Comments accepted on First Draft (10 weeks)
- If Standard does not receive Public Comments and the Committee does not wish to further revise the Standard, the Standard becomes a Consent Standard and is sent directly to the Standards Council for issuance
- Committee holds Second Draft Meeting (21 weeks)
- Committee(s) with Correlating Committee (7 weeks)
- Committee ballots on Second Draft (11 weeks)
- Committee(s) with Correlating Committee (10 weeks)
- Correlating Committee First Draft Meeting (9 weeks)
- Correlating Committee ballots on First Draft (8 weeks)
- Second Draft Report posted

### Step 3: Association Technical Meeting

[Content continues...]

- **Notice of Intent to Make a Motion (NITMAM) accepted (5 weeks)**
  - NITMAMs are reviewed and valid motions are certified for presentation at the Association Technical Meeting.
  - Consent Standard bypasses Association Technical Meeting and proceeds directly to the Standards Council for issuance.
  - NFPA membership meets each June at the Association Technical Meeting and acts on Standards with "Certified Amending Motions" (certified NITMAMS).
  - Committee(s) and Panel(s) vote on any successful amendments to the Technical Committee Reports made by the NFPA membership at the Association Technical Meeting.

## Step 4: Council Appeals and Issuance of Standard

- Notification of intent to file an appeal to the Standards Council on Association action must be filed within 20 days of the Association Technical Meeting.
- Standards Council decides, based on all evidence, whether or not to issue the Standards or to take other action.

## Committee Membership Classifications

The following classifications apply to Committee members and represent their principal interest in the activity of the Committee.

1. **M Manufacturer**: A representative of a maker or marketer of a product, assembly, or system, or portion thereof, that is affected by the standard.
2. **U User**: A representative of an entity that is subject to the provisions of the standard or that voluntarily uses the standard.
3. **IM Installer/Maintainer**: A representative of an entity that is in the business of installing or maintaining a product, assembly, or system affected by the standard.
4. **L Labor**: A labor representative or employee concerned with safety in the workplace.
5. **RT Applied Research/Testing Laboratory**: A representative of an independent testing laboratory or independent applied research organization that promulgates and/or enforces standards.
6. **E Enforcing Authority**: A representative of an agency or an organization that promulgates and/or enforces standards.
7. **I Insurance**: A representative of an insurance company, broker, agent, bureau, or inspection agency.
8. **C Consumer**: A person who is or represents the ultimate purchaser of a product, system, or service affected by the standard, but who is not included in (2).
9. **SE Special Expert**: A person not representing (1) through (8) and who has special expertise in the scope of the standard or portion thereof.

**NOTE 1**: "Standard" connotes code, standard, recommended practice, or guide.

**NOTE 2**: A representative includes an employee.

**NOTE 3**: While these classifications will be used by the Standards Council to achieve a balance for Technical Committees, the Standards Council may determine that new classifications of member or unique interests need representation in order to foster the best possible Committee deliberations on any project. In this connection, the Standards Council may make such appointments as it deems appropriate in the public interest, such as the classification of "Utilities" in the National Electrical Code Committee.

**NOTE 4**: Representatives of subsidiaries of any group are generally considered to have the same classification as the parent organization.

## Information on the NFPA Standards Development Process

### I. Applicable Regulations

The primary rules governing the processing of NFPA standards (codes, standards, recommended practices, and guides) are the NFPA Regulations Governing the Development of NFPA Standards (Regs). Other applicable rules include NFPA Bylaws, NFPA Technical Meeting Convention Rules, NFPA Guide for the Conduct of Participants in the NFPA Standards Development Process, and the NFPA Regulations Governing Petitions to the Board of Directors from Decisions of the Standards Council. Most of these rules and regulations are contained in the NFPA Standards Directory. For copies of the Directory, contact Codes and Standards Administration at NFPA Headquarters; all these documents are also available on the NFPA website at [www.nfpa.org](http://www.nfpa.org).

The following is general information on the NFPA process. All participants, however, should refer to the actual rules and regulations for a full understanding of this process and for the criteria that govern participation.

## II. Technical Committee Report

The Technical Committee Report is defined as "the Report of the responsible Committee(s), in accordance with the Regulations, in preparation of a new or revised NFPA Standard." The Technical Committee Report is in two parts and consists of the First Draft Report and the Second Draft Report. (See Regs at 1.4)

## III. Step 1: First Draft Report

The First Draft Report is defined as "Part one of the Technical Committee Report, which documents the Input Stage." The First Draft Report consists of the First Draft, Public Input, Committee Input, Committee and Correlating Committee Statements, Correlating Input, Correlating Notes, and Ballot Statements. (See Regs at 4.2.5.2 and Section 4.3)

Any objection to an action in the First Draft Report must be raised through the filing of an appropriate Comment for consideration in the Second Draft Report or the objection will be considered resolved. [See Regs at 4.3.1(b)]

## IV. Step 2: Second Draft Report

The Second Draft Report is defined as "Part two of the Technical Committee Report, which documents the Comment Stage." The Second Draft Report consists of the Second Draft, Public Comments with corresponding Committee Actions and Committee Statements, Correlating Notes and their respective Committee Statements, Committee Comments, Correlating Revisions, and Ballot Statements. (See Regs at Section 4.2.5.2 and 4.4)

The First Draft Report and the Second Draft Report together constitute the Technical Committee Report. Any outstanding objection following the Second Draft Report must be raised through an appropriate Amending Motion at the Association Technical Meeting or the objection will be considered resolved. [See Regs at 4.4.1(b)]

## V. Step 3a: Action at Association Technical Meeting

Following the publication of the Second Draft Report, there is a period during which those wishing to make proper Amending Motions on the Technical Committee Reports must signal their intention by submitting a Notice of Intent to Make a Motion. (See Regs at 4.5.2)

Standards that receive notice of proper Amending Motions (Certified Amending Motions) will be presented for action at the annual June Association Technical Meeting. At the meeting, the NFPA membership can consider and act on these Certified Amending Motions as well as Follow-up Amending Motions, that is, motions that become necessary as a result of a previous successful Amending Motion. (See 4.5.3.2 through 4.5.3.6 and Table 1, Columns 1-3 of Regs for a summary of the available Amending Motions and who may make them.)

Any outstanding objection following action at an Association Technical Meeting (and any further Technical Committee consideration following successful Amending Motions, see Regs at 4.5.3.7 through 4.6.5.3) must be raised through an appeal to the Standards Council or it will be considered to be resolved.

## VI. Step 3b: Documents Forwarded Directly to the Council

Where no Notice of Intent to Make a Motion (NITMAM) is received and certified in accordance with the Technical Meeting Convention Rules, the standard is forwarded directly to the Standards Council for action on issuance. Objections are deemed to be resolved for these documents. (See Regs at 4.5.2.5)

## VII. Step 4a: Council Appeals

Anyone can appeal to the Standards Council concerning procedural or substantive matters related to the development, content, or issuance of any document of the Association or on matters within the purview of the authority of the Council, as established by the Bylaws and as determined by the Board of Directors. Such appeals must be in written form and filed with the Secretary of the Standards Council. (See Regs at 1.6)

Time constraints for filing an appeal must be in accordance with 1.6.2 of the Regs. Objections are deemed to be resolved if not pursued at this level.

## VIII. Step 4b: Document Issuance

The Standards Council is the issuer of all documents (see Article 8 of Bylaws). The Council acts on the issuance of a document presented for action at an Association Technical Meeting within 75 days from the date of the recommendation from the Association Technical Meeting, unless this period is extended by the Council (See Regs at 4.7.2). For documents forwarded directly to the Standards Council, the Council acts on the issuance of the document at its next scheduled meeting, or at such other meeting as the Council may determine (See Regs at 4.5.2.5 and 4.7.4).

## IX. Petitions to the Board of Directors

The Standards Council has been delegated the responsibility for the administration of the codes and standards development process and the issuance of documents. However, where extraordinary circumstances requiring the intervention of the Board of Directors exist, the Board of Directors may take any action necessary to fulfill its obligations to preserve the integrity of the codes and standards development process and to protect the interests of the Association. The rules for petitioning the Board of Directors can be found in the Regulations Governing Petitions to the Board of Directors from Decisions of the Standards Council and in 1.7 of the Regs.

## X. For More Information

The program for the Association Technical Meeting (as well as the NFPA website as information becomes available) should be consulted for the date on which each report scheduled for consideration at the meeting will be presented. For copies of the First Draft Report and Second Draft Report as well as more information on NFPA rules and for up-to-date information on schedules and deadlines for processing NFPA documents, check the NFPA website (www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes) or contact NFPA Codes & Standards Administration at (617) 984-7246.
