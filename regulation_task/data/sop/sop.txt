# Standard Operating Procedure for Biodegradable Packaging Materials

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the procedures for handling, testing, and disposing of biodegradable packaging materials in accordance with ASTM D6400 standards.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to all personnel involved in the production, testing, and disposal of biodegradable packaging materials.

## 3. Responsibilities
- Production Manager: Ensure compliance with specifications
- Quality Control: Perform testing procedures
- Disposal Team: Properly handle waste materials

## 4. Definitions
- Biodegradable: Materials that can be broken down by natural processes
- Compostable: Materials that biodegrade within a specified timeframe under composting conditions
- ASTM D6400: Standard Specification for Labeling of Plastics Designed to be Aerobically Composted in Municipal or Industrial Facilities

## 5. Safety Requirements
Personnel must wear appropriate PPE when handling materials. 
Note: This section intentionally lacks specific PPE requirements.

## 6. Materials Testing Procedures
6.1 All packaging must be tested according to ASTM D6400 standards
6.2 Testing shall include evaluation of biodegradation rate and environmental impact
6.3 Materials must achieve at least 90% biodegradation within 180 days

## 7. Documentation
7.1 Maintain records of all testing procedures and results
7.2 Document compliance with IEEE 802.11 for wireless data transmission systems
7.3 Ensure all documentation is retained for at least 5 years

## 8. Disposal Procedures
8.1 Materials should be sent to industrial composting facilities
8.2 Partial degradation materials must be properly labeled
8.3 Non-compliant materials should be segregated and processed separately

## 9. Non-Compliance Actions
If materials fail to meet specifications, production must be halted until issues are resolved.
